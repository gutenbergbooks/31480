<h2>The Three Tigers</h2>


<p>As to Tiger Number One, what he likes best is
prowling and hunting. He snuffs at all the interesting
and exciting smells there are on the breeze;
that dark breeze that tells him the secrets the
jungle has hid: every nerve in his body is alert,
every hair in his whiskers; his eyes gleam; he's
ready for anything. He and Life are at grips.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/ill_012.png" width="225" height="199" alt="Reading Tiger in Rockingchair" title="Reading Tiger in Rockingchair" />
</div>

<p>Number Two is a
higher-browed tiger, in
a nice cozy cave. He
has spectacles; he sits in
a rocking-chair reading a
book. And the book describes
all the exciting
smells there are on the
breeze, and tells him what happens in the jungle,
where nerves are alert; where adventure, death,
hunting and passion are found every night. He
spends his life reading about them, in a nice
cozy cave.</p>

<p>It's a curious practice. You'd think if he
were interested in jungle life he'd go out and
live it. There it is, waiting for him, and that's
what he really is here for. But he makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cave and shuts himself off from it&mdash;and then
reads about it!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Once upon a time some victims of the book-habit
got into heaven; and what do you think,
they behaved there exactly as here. That was
to be expected, however: habits get so ingrained.
They never took the trouble to explore
their new celestial surroundings; they sat in the
harp store-room all eternity, and read about
heaven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill_014.png" width="450" height="540" alt="Book-lovers in Heaven" title="Book-lovers in Heaven" />
<span class="caption">Book-lovers in Heaven</span>
</div>

<p>They said they could really learn more about
heaven, that way.</p>

<p>And in fact, so they could. They could get
more information, and faster. But information's
pretty thin stuff, unless mixed with experience.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But that's not the worst. It is Tiger Number
Three who's the worst. He not only reads
all the time, but he wants what he reads sweetened
up. He objects to any sad or uncomfortable
account of outdoors; he says it's sad
enough in his cave; he wants something uplifting
So authors obediently prepare uplifting accounts
of the jungle, or they try to make the jungle
look pretty, or funny, or something; and
Number Three reads every such tale with great
satisfaction. And since he's indoors all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and never sees the real jungle, he soon gets to
think that these nice books he reads may be true;
and if new books describe the jungle the way it is,
he says they're unhealthy. "There are aspects of
life in the jungle," he says, getting hot, "that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
decent tiger should ever be aware of, or notice."</p>


<p>Tiger Number Two speaks with contempt of
these feelings of Three's.    Tigers should have
more courage.    They should bravely read about
the real jungle.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The realist and the romantic tiger are agreed
upon one point, however. They both look down
on tigers that don't read but merely go out and
live.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>As They Go Riding By</h2>


<p>What kind of men do we think the mediæval
knights really were? I have always seen
them in a romantic light, finer than human.
Tennyson gave me that apple, and I confess
I did eat, and I have lived on the wrong
diet ever since. Malory was almost as misleading.
My net impression was that there were a
few wicked, villainous knights, who committed
crimes such as not trusting other knights or saying
mean things, but that even they were subject
to shame when found out and rebuked, and that
all the rest were a fine, earnest Y. M. C. A.
crowd, with the noblest ideals.</p>

<p>But only the poets hold this view of knights,
not the scholars. Here, for example, is a cold-hearted
scholar, Monsieur Albert Guerard. He
has been digging into the old mediæval records
with an unromantic eye, hang him; and he has
emerged with his hands full of facts which prove
the knights were quite different. They did have
some good qualities. When invaders came around
the knights fought them off as nobly as possible;
and they often went away and fought Saracens or
ogres or such, and when thus engaged they gave
little trouble to the good folk at home.   But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
between wars, not being educated, they couldn't
sit still and be quiet. It was dull in the house.
They liked action. So they rode around the
streets in a pugnacious, wild-western manner,
despising anyone who could read and often
knocking him down; and making free with the personal
property of merchants and peasants, who
they thought had no special right to property
or even to life. Knights who felt rough behaved
as such, and the injuries they inflicted were often
fatal.</p>

<p>They must have been terrors. Think of being
a merchant or cleric without any armor, and
meeting a gang of ironclads, with the nearest police
court centuries off! Why, they might do anything,
and whatever they did to a merchant, they
thought was a joke. Whenever they weren't
beating you up they fought with one another like
demons&mdash;I don't mean just in tournaments, which
were for practice, but in small, private wars.
And to every war, public or private, citizens had
to contribute; and instead of being thanked for
it, they were treated with the utmost contempt.</p>

<p>Suppose a handsome young citizen, seeing this
and feeling ambitious, tried to join the gang and
become a knight himself. Would they let him?
No! At first, if he were a powerful fighter, he
did have a small chance, but as time went on and
the knights got to feeling more noble than ever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
being not only knights but the sons of knights,
they wouldn't let in a new man. The mere idea
made them so indignant they wanted to lynch him.
"Their loathing for the people seemed almost
akin in its intensity to color prejudice."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_018.png" width="400" height="262" alt="Knight and Citizen" title="Knight and Citizen" />
</div>

<p>They were also extravagant and improvident
and never made money, so the more they spent
the more they had to demand from the people.
When every one had been squeezed dry for miles
around, and had been thumped to make sure,
the knights cursed horribly and borrowed from
the Church, whether the Church would or no, or
got hold of some money-lender and pulled his
beard and never paid interest.</p>

<p>The Church tried to make them religious and
partly succeeded; there were some Christian
knights who were soldierly and courtly, of course.
But, allowing for this (and for my exaggerating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
their bad side, for the moment), they certainly
were not the kind of men Tennyson led me to
think.</p>

<p>I do not blame Tennyson. He had a perfect
right to romanticize. He may have known what
toughs the knights were as well as anybody, but
loved their noble side, too, and dreamed about it
until he had made it for the moment seem real to
him, and then hurried up and written his idyls before
the dream cracked. He may never have intended
me or any of us to swallow it whole. "It's
not a dashed bible; it's a book of verse," I can
imagine him saying, "so don't be an idiot; don't
forget to read your encyclopedia, too."</p>

<p>But verse is mightier than any encyclopedia. At
least it prevails. That's because the human race
is emotional and goes by its feelings. Why
haven't encyclopedists considered this? They are
the men I should blame. What is the use of embodying
the truth about everything in a precise
condensed style which, even if we read it, we
can't remember, since it does not stir our feelings?
The encyclopedists should write their books over
again, in passionate verse. What we need in an
encyclopedia is lyrical fervor, not mere
completeness&mdash;Idyls of Economic Jurisprudence, Songs of
the Nitrates. Our present compendiums are
meant for scholars rather than people.</p>

<p>Well, the knights are gone and only their armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and weapons remain; and our rich merchants
who no longer are under-dogs, collect these as
curios. They present them with a magnificent
gesture to local museums. The metal suit which
old Sir Percy Mortimer wore, when riding down
merchants, is now in the Briggsville Academy,
which never heard of Sir Percy, and his armor is
a memorial to Samuel Briggs of the Briggs Tailoring
Company. In Europe a few ancient families,
in financial decay, are guarding their ancestors'
clothing as well as they can, but sooner or
later they will be driven to sell it, to live. And
they won't live much longer at that. The race
will soon be extinct.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_020.png" width="400" height="296" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Last year I got a bulletin of the Metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Museum of Art about armor. It described how
an American collector saw a fine set in Paris.
"A single view was quite enough to enable him to
decide that the armor was too important to remain
in private hands." And that settled it.
These collectors are determined fellows and must
have their own way&mdash;like the knights.</p>

<p>But there were difficulties this time. They
couldn't at first get this set. The knightly owner
of the armor, "in whose family it was an heirloom,
was, from our point of view, singularly unreasonable:
he ... was unwilling to part with
it; the psychological crisis when he would allow
it to pass out of his hands must, therefore, be
awaited." For there comes "a propitious moment
in cases of this kind," adds the bulletin.</p>

<p>Yes, "in cases of this kind" collectors comfortably
wait for that crisis when the silent old
knightly owner finally has to give in. They leave
agents to watch him while he struggles between
want and pride, agents who will snap him up if a
day comes when the old man is weak. These
agents must be persistent and shrewd, and must
present tactful arguments, and must shoo away
other agents, if possible, so as to keep down the
price. When the "propitious" time comes they
must act quickly, lest the knight's weakness pass,
or lest some other knight send him help and thus
make them wait longer.    And, having got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
armor, they hurry it off, give a dinner, and other
merchants come to view it and measure it and
count up the pieces.</p>

<p>This sort of thing has been happening over and
over in Europe&mdash;the closing scenes of the order of
knighthood, not foreseen at gay tournaments!
They were lucky in those days not to be able to
look into the future. Are <i>we</i> lucky to be blind,
at Mount Vernon or on some old campus? The
new times to come may be better&mdash;that always is
possible&mdash;but they won't be the kind we are building,
and they may scrap our shrines.</p>

<p>Some day when our modern types of capitalists
are extinct, in their turn, will future poets sing of
their fine deeds and make young readers dream?
Our capitalists are not popular in these days, but
the knights weren't in theirs, and whenever abuse
grows extreme a reaction will follow. Our critics
and reformers think <i>they</i> will be the heroes of
song, but do we sing of critics who lived in the
ages of chivalry? There must have been reformers
then who pleaded the cause of down-trodden
citizens, and denounced and exposed cruel knights,
but we don't know their names. It is the knights
we remember and idealize, even old Front-de-B&oelig;uf.
They were doers&mdash;and the men of the future
will idealize ours. Our predatory interests
will seem to them gallant and strong. When a
new Tennyson appears, he will never look up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
things in our newspapers; he won't even read the
encyclopedia&mdash;Tennysons don't. He will get his
conception of capitalists out of his heart.
Mighty men who built towers to work in, and
fought with one another, and engaged in great
capitalist wars, and stood high above labor.
King Carnegie and his round directors' table of
barons of steel. Armour, Hill and Stillman, Jay
Gould&mdash;musical names, fit for poems.</p>

<p>The men of the future will read, and disparage
their era, and wish they had lived in the wild
clashing times we have now. They will try to
enliven the commonplaceness of their tame daily
lives by getting up memorial pageants where they
can dress up as capitalists&mdash;some with high hats
and umbrellas (borrowed from the museums),
some as golfers or polo players, carrying the
queer ancient implements. Beautiful girls will
happily unbuckle their communist suits and dress
up in old silken low-necks, hired from a costumer.
Little boys will look on with awe as the procession
goes by, and then hurry off to the back yard and
play they are great financiers. And if some essay,
like this, says the capitalists were not all
noble, but a mixed human lot like the knights,
many with selfish, harsh ways, the reader will turn
from it restlessly. We need these illusions.</p>

<p>Ah, well, if we must romanticize something, it
had best be the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>A man gets up in the morning and looks out at
the weather, and dresses, and goes to his work,
and says hello to his friends, and plays a little pool
in the evening and gets into bed. But only a part
of him has been active in doing all that. He has a
something else in him&mdash;a wondering instinct&mdash;a
"soul." Assuming he isn't religious, what does
he do with <i>that</i> part of him?</p>

<p>He usually keeps that part of him asleep if he
can. He doesn't like to let it wake up and look
around at the world, because it asks awful questions&mdash;about
death, or truth&mdash;and that makes
him uncomfortable. He wants to be cheery and
he hates to have his soul interfere. The soul is
too serious and the best thing to do is to deaden it.</p>

<p>Humor is an opiate for the soul, says Francis
Hackett. Laugh it off: that's one way of not
facing a trouble. Sentimentality, too, drugs the
soul; so does business. That's why humor and
sentimentality and business are popular.</p>

<p>In Russia, it's different. Their souls are
more awake, and less covered. The Russians
are not businesslike, and they're not sentimental,
or humorous. They are spiritually naked by
contrast. An odd, moody people. We look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
on, well wrapped-up, and wonder why they shiver
at life.</p>

<p>"My first interest," the Russian explains,
"is to know where I stand: I must look at the past,
and the seas of space about me, and the intricate
human drama on this little planet. Before I can
attend to affairs, or be funny, or tender, I must
know whether the world's any good. Life may
all be a fraud."</p>

<p>The Englishman and American answer that
this is not practical. They don't believe in anyone's
sitting down to stare at the Sphinx. "That
won't get you anywhere," they tell him. "You
must be up and doing. Find something that interests
you, then do it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, and what?" says the Russian.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;and you'll find out as much
of the Riddle in that way as any."</p>

<p>"And how much is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, not so very damn much perhaps," we answer.
"But at least you'll keep sane."</p>

<p>"Why keep sane?" says the Russian. "If
there is any point to so doing I should naturally
wish to. But if one can't find a meaning to anything,
what is the difference?"</p>

<p>And the American and Englishman continue to
recommend business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>Odd Countries</h2>


<p>When I go away for a vacation, which I
don't any more, I am or was appalled at the ridiculous
inconveniences of it. I have sometimes
gone to the Great Mother, Nature; sometimes to
hotels. Well, the Great Mother is kind, it is said,
to the birds and the beasts, the small furry creatures,
and even, of old, to the Indian. But I am
no Indian; I am not even a small furry creature.
I dislike the Great Mother. She's damp: and
far too full of insects.</p>

<p>And as for hotels, the man in the next room
always snores. And by the time you get used
to this, and get in
with some gang,
your vacation is
over and you have
to turn around and
go home.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ill_027.png" width="250" height="217" alt="The farmer who hates you on sight" title="The farmer who hates you on sight" />
<span class="caption">The farmer who hates you on sight</span>
</div>

<p>I can get more
for my money by
far from a book.
For example, the
Oppenheim novels: there are fifty-three of them,
and to read them is almost like going on fifty-three
tours. A man and his whole family could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
take six for the price of one pair of boots. Instead
of trying to find some miserable mosquitoey
hotel at the sea-shore, or an old farmer's
farmhouse where the old farmer will hate you on
sight, and instead of
packing a trunk and
running errands and
catching a train I go
to a book-shop and
buy any Oppenheim
novel. When I go
on a tour with him,
I start off so quickly
and easily. I sit in my armchair, I turn to the
first page, and it's like having a taxi at the door&mdash;"Here's
your car, sir, all ready!" The minute
I read that first page I am off like a shot, into a
world where things never stop happening. Magnificent
things! It's about as swift a change as
you could ask from jog-trot daily life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ill_028.png" width="250" height="211" alt="Is she an adventuress?" title="Is she an adventuress?" />
<span class="caption">Is she an adventuress?</span>
</div>

<p>On page two, I suddenly discover that beautiful
women surround me. Are they adventuresses?
I cannot tell. I must beware every
minute. Everybody is wary and suave, and they
are all princes and diplomats. The atmosphere is
heavy with the clashing of powerful wills. Paid
murderers and spies are about. Hah! am I being
watched? The excitement soon gets to a point
where it goes to my head. I find myself muttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thickly or biting my lips&mdash;two things I never
do ordinarily and should not think of doing. I
may even give a hoarse cry of rage as I sit in my
armchair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">I wonder if I&#39;m being watched?</span>
</div>

<p>But I'm not in my armchair. I am on
a terrace, alone, in the moonlight. A beautiful
woman (a reliable one) comes swiftly toward me.
Either she is enormously rich or else I am, but we
don't think of that. We embrace each other.
Hark! There is the duke, busily muttering
thickly. How am I to reply to him? I decide to
give him a hoarse cry of rage. He bites his lips
at me. Some one else shoots us both. All is
over.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If any one is too restless to take his vacation
in books, the quaintest and queerest of countries is
just around the corner.    An immigrant is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
allowed to stay from 8.15 to 11 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, but an
hour in this country does more for you than a
week in the mountains. No canned fish and vegetables,
no babies&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_030.png" width="500" height="306" alt="Babies seem so dissatisfied" title="Babies seem so dissatisfied" />
<span class="caption">Babies seem so dissatisfied</span>
</div>

<p>I wonder, by the way, why most babies find
existence so miserable? Convicts working on
roadways, stout ladies in tight shoes and corsets,
teachers of the French language&mdash;none of these
suffering souls wail in public; <i>they</i> don't go around
with puckered-up faces, distorted and screaming,
and beating the air with clenched fists. Then why
babies? You may say it's the nurse; but look at
the patients in hospitals. They put up not only
with illness, but nurses besides. No, babies are
unreasonable; they expect far too much of existence.
Each new generation that comes takes one
look at the world, thinks wildly, "Is <i>this</i> all they've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
done to it?" and bursts into tears. "You might
have got the place ready for us," they would say,
only they can't speak the language. "What <i>have</i>
you been doing all these thousands of years on this
planet? It's messy, it's badly policed, badly laid
out and built&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, Baby. It's dreadful. I don't know
why we haven't done better. I said just now that
you were unreasonable, but I take it all back.
Statesmen complain if their servants fail to keep
rooms and kitchens in order, but are statesmen
themselves any good at getting the world tidied
up? No, we none of us are. We all find it a
wearisome business.</p>

<p>Let us go to that country I spoke of, the one
round the corner. We stroll through its entrance,
and we're in Theatrical-Land.</p>

<p>A remarkable country. May God bless the
man who invented it. I always am struck by its
ways, it's so odd and delightful&mdash;</p>

<p>"But," some one objects (it is possible), "it
isn't real."</p>

<p>Ah, my dear sir, what world, then, <i>is</i> real,
as a matter of fact? You won't deny that it's not
only children who live in a world of their own,
but débutantes, college boys, business men&mdash;certainly
business men, so absorbed in their game
that they lose sight of other realities. In fact,
there is no one who doesn't lose sight of some, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there? Well, that's all that the average play
does. It drops just a few out. To be sure,
when it does that, it shows us an incomplete world,
and hence not the real one; but that is characteristic
of humans. We spend our lives moving
from one incomplete world to another, from our
homes to our clubs or our offices, laughing or grumbling,
talking rapidly, reading the paper, and not
doing much thinking outside of our grooves.
Daily life is more comfortable, somehow, if you
narrow your vision. When you try to take in all
the realities, all the far-away high ones, you must
first become quite still and lonely. And then in
your loneliness a fire begins to creep through your
veins. It's&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know much about it.
Shall we return to the theater?</p>

<p>The oddest of all entertainments is a musical
comedy. I remember that during the war we had
one about Belgium. When the curtain went up,
soldiers were talking by the light of a lantern, and
clapping each other on the shoulder when their
feelings grew deep. They exchanged many well-worded
thoughts on their deep feelings, too, and
they spoke these thoughts briskly and readily, for
it was the eve of a battle. One of the soldiers
blinked his eye now and then. He was taking it
hard. He said briskly he probably would never
see his mother again.</p>

<p>His comrade, being affected by this, clapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his friend on the shoulder, and said, Oh yes he
would, and cheer up.</p>

<p>The other looked at him, stepped forward
(with his chest well expanded), and said ringingly:
"I was not thinking of myself, Jean. I was thinking
of Bel-jum."</p>

<p>It was a trifle confusing, but we applauded
him roundly for this. The light from the balcony
shown full on the young hero's face. You could
see he was ready for the enemy&mdash;his dark-rouged
cheeks, his penciled eyebrows proved it. He offered
to sing us a song, on the subject of home.
His comrade hurried forward and clapped him
some more on the shoulder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ill_033.png" width="220" height="258" alt="Songs of home" title="Songs of home" />
<span class="caption">Songs of home</span>
</div>

<p>The orchestra started.</p>

<p>"<i>Muth-aw</i>,</p>

<p>"<i>Muth-aw</i>,"
roared the hero, standing
stiffly at attention,</p>

<p>"<i>Let your arms en-fo-o-ho-old
me.</i>"</p>

<p>All was silent on the firing-line&mdash;except
of course,
for this singing. The
enemy waited politely.
The orchestra played on. Then the song ended,
and promptly the banging of guns was heard in
the distance&mdash;and a rather mild bang hit the shed
and the lantern went out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The audience was left there to shudder alone,
in the darkness, not knowing whether the hero
was dead&mdash;though, of course, we had hopes....
Then up went the curtain, and there he stood
by a château, where a plump Belgian maid, dressed
in white silk, was pouring high tea.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ill_034.png" width="220" height="210" alt="In Belgium?" title="In Belgium?" />
<span class="caption">In Belgium?</span>
</div>

<p>An American war-correspondent
appeared
on the scene. He was
the humorous character
of the performance.
He was always in
trouble over his passports.
He had with
him a Red Cross nurse
who capered about, singing songs, as did also eight
Belgian girls, from the neighboring farms. Belgian
girls are all young and tuneful, the audience
learned, and they spend their time during wars
dancing with war-correspondents. They wear
fresh, pretty clothes. So do soldiers who come
home on leave. Sky-blue uniforms, gilt, shiny
boots. All was smiling in Bel-jum.</p>

<p>Then the clock struck eleven. The curtain
went down, like a wall. We were turned out, like
poor Cinderella, into the cold, noisy streets.
Dense pushing crowds. Newsboys shouting,
"Great Slaughter in Flanders." The wails of
some baby attempting to get used to existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2>On Cows</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ill_035.png" width="220" height="345" alt="If cows had time&mdash;" title="If cows had time&mdash;" />
<span class="caption">If cows had time&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p>I was thinking the other evening of cows.
You say Why? I can't tell you. But it came to
me, all of a sudden, that cows lead hard lives. It
takes such a lot of grass, apparently, to keep a cow
going that she has to spend all her time eating, day
in and day out. Dogs bounce around and bark,
horses caper, birds fly, also sing, while the cow
looks on, enviously, maybe, unable to join them.
Cows may long for conversation or prancing, for
all that we know, but
they can't spare the time.
The problem of nourishment
takes every hour:
a pause might be fatal.
So they go through life
drearily eating, resentful
and dumb. Their food
is most uninteresting,
and is frequently covered
with bugs; and their
thoughts, if they dwell
on their hopeless careers,
must be bitter.</p>


<p>In the old days, when huge and strange animals
roamed through the world, there was an era<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
when great size was necessary, as a protection.
All creatures that could do so grew large. It was
only thus they felt safe. But as soon as they became
large, the grass-eating creatures began to
have trouble, because of the fact that grass has a
low nutritive value. You take a dinosaur, for instance,
who was sixty or seventy feet long. Imagine
what a hard task it must have been for him,
every day, to get enough grass down his throat to
supply his vast body. Do you wonder that, as
scientists tell us, they died of exhaustion? Some
starved to death even while feverishly chewing
their cud&mdash;the remoter parts of their bodies fainting
from famine while their fore-parts got fed.</p>

<p>This exasperating fate is what darkens the mind
of the cow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2>Stroom and Graith</h2>

<span class="caption">When Graith was young</span>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Graith was young, and Stroom returned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From conquering the Northern Stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed to her the road he'd burned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Across the sky, to make his wars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiled at Fear, and hid his scars&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He little dreamed his fate could hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doom of dwarfish avatars<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Vega sent, when Stroom was old.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When you are talking things over with any
one, you have to take some precautions. If you
have just come from a cathedral, and try to discuss
its stained glass, with the janitor of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
apartment house, say,&mdash;why, it won't be much use,
because stained glass means to him bathroom
windows, and that's all his mind will run on. I
am in exactly that position at this moment. I
don't mean bathroom windows, I mean what is the
use of my saying a word about Stroom and Graith,
to any one who may think they are a firm of provision
dealers in Yonkers. Any woman who began
this essay thinking that Graith was a new perfume,&mdash;any
man who said to himself "Stroom?
Oh, yes: that Bulgarian ferment,"&mdash;are readers
who would really do better to go and read something
else.</p>

<p>Having settled that, I must now admit that
until yesterday I knew nothing about them myself.
Yet, centuries ago, Stroom and Graith were on
every one's tongues. Then, I don't know what
happened, but a strange silence about them began.
One by one, those who had spoken of them freely
in some way were hushed. The chronicles of the
times became silent, and named them no more.</p>

<p>We think when we open our histories, we
open the past. We open only such a small part
of it! Great tracts disappear. Forgetfulness
or secret taboos draw the dim curtains down, and
hide from our sight awful thoughts, monstrous
deeds, monstrous dooms....</p>

<p>Even now, in the bright lights and courage
of the era we live in, there has been only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
writer who has ventured to name Stroom and
Graith.</p>

<p>His name was Dixon; he was at Oxford, in
the fifties, with that undergraduate group which
included Burne-Jones, William Morris, and on
the outside, Rossetti. Where he found what so
long had been hidden, even he does not say.
But he wrote certain poems, in which Stroom
and Graith, and the Agraffe appear.</p>

<p>This fact is recorded in only one book that
I know of, and that is in the fifth volume of Mr.
T. Humphry Ward's English Poets. When I
opened this book, I read for the first time
about Dixon. I also read one of his poems,
which was wildish and weird:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Go now from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far ruined: the grey shingly floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy crashing step answers, the doteril cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on dipping wing flies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis their silence!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not knowing what a doteril was, I looked
to see if the editor had explained: but no, all he
said was that Dixon was fond of such words.</p>

<p>He added that others such as Stroom, Graith,
and Agraffe appeared in his poems.</p>

<p>But he didn't print those poems in this collection,
or explain those strange names.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_040.png" width="500" height="396" alt="Where the doteril cries" title="Where the doteril cries" />
<span class="caption">Where the doteril cries</span>
</div>

<p>The sound of them fascinated me. I sat there
and dreamed for a while; and it was out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
these dreamings that I wrote that verse at the
head of this essay. Some stern and vast mystery
seemed to me about to enfold. What part
the Agraffe played in it (a mediæval beast I imagined)
I could not know, could not guess. But
I pictured a strong-hearted Stroom to myself as
some hero, waging far, lonely fights, against
foes on the edge of the skies; and I dreamed of
how Vega stood waiting, until Stroom married
Graith, and of how at the height of his majesty
she inflicted her doom&mdash;a succession of abhorrent
rebirths as a grotesque little dwarf.</p>

<p>Still, these were only my imaginings, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
wanted the records. I sent to the public library,
and got out all of Dixon they had. Great red
and gold volumes. But the one that I wanted&mdash;not
there.... I sent to several famous universities....
It was not to be found.</p>

<p>I turned my search over to an obliging old
friend, a librarian, and sat down feeling thwarted,
to console myself with some other poet. There
were many in Volume V of the English Poets, but
not a one of them calmed me. I read restlessly
every day, waiting to hear about Stroom. Then
at last, one rainy evening, a telegram came! It
was from that old friend. "Have found all those
words Dixon used, in a dialect dictionary. It
gives: 'Stroom: rightly strom: a malt strainer,
a wicker-work basket or bottle, placed under the
bunghole of a mash-tub to strain off the hops.'
Mr. Dixon used it because he loved its sound, I
suppose. As to Graith, it means 'furniture, equipment,
apparatus for traveling.' And agraffes
are the ornamented hooks used to fasten Knights'
armor. They are mentioned in Ivanhoe."</p>

<p>Well, poets are always disappointing me.</p>

<p>I don't know why I read them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>However, having bought Volume V to read, I
tried to keep on with it.</p>

<p>I read what it said about Browning's father
being a banker. Poor old man, I felt sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
him. Imagine the long years when he and his son
faced each other, the old father telling himself
hopefully, "Ah, well, he's a child, he'll get over
these queer poetical ways,"&mdash;and then his <i>not</i>
getting over them, but proposing to give his life
to poetry! Make a career of it!</p>

<p>If there are any kind of men who want sons
like themselves, it's our bankers: they have their
banks to hand on, and they long to have nice
banker babies. But it seems they are constantly
begetting impossible infants. Cardinal Newman
for instance: his bewildered father too was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
banker. Fate takes a special pleasure in tripping
these worthy men up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_042.png" width="500" height="413" alt="MURDER!&mdash;All&#39;s right with the world.&mdash;Pippa Passes." title="MURDER!&mdash;All&#39;s right with the world.&mdash;Pippa Passes" />
<span class="caption">MURDER!&mdash;All&#39;s right with the world.&mdash;Pippa Passes.</span>
</div>

<p>Imagine Browning senior reading "Pippa
Passes," with pursed lips, at his desk. What
mental pictures of his son's heroine did the old
gentleman form, as he followed her on her now
famous walk through that disreputable neighborhood?</p>

<p>I hope he enjoyed more "How They Brought
the Good News from Ghent." For example,
where the man says, while galloping fast down
the road:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I turned in my saddle and made the girths tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_043.png" width="500" height="249" alt="He made the girths tight" title="He made the girths tight" />
<span class="caption">He made the girths tight</span>
</div>

<p>The banker must have been pleased that Robert
could harness a horse in rhyme anyhow. I dare
say he knew as we all do that it was poor enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
poetry, but at least it was practical. It was something
he could tell his friends at the club.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Putting Browning aside with poor Stroom, I
next tried Matthew Arnold.</p>

<p>The Arnolds: a great family, afflicted with an
unfortunate strain. Unusually good qualities,&mdash;but
they feel conscientious about them.</p>

<p>If Matthew Arnold had only been born into
some other family! If he had only been the son
of C. S. Calverley or Charles II, for instance.</p>

<p>He had a fine mind, and he and it matured
early. Both were Arnold characteristics. But
so was his conscientiously setting himself to enrich
his fine mind "by the persistent study of 'the best
that is known and thought in the world.'" This
was deadening. Gentlemen who teach themselves
just how and what to appreciate, take half the
vitality out of their appreciation thereafter.
They go out and collect all "the best" and bring
it carefully home, and faithfully pour it down
their throats&mdash;and get drunk on it? No! It
loses its lift and intoxication, taken like that.</p>

<p>An aspiring concern with good art is supposed
to be meritorious. People "ought" to go to
museums and concerts, and they "ought" to read
poetry. It is a mark of superiority to have a
full supply of the most correct judgments.</p>

<p>This doctrine is supposed to be beyond discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Leo Stein says. "I do not think it is beyond
discussion," he adds. "It is more nearly
beneath it.... To teach or formally to encourage
the appreciation of art does more harm than
good.... It tries to make people see things
that they do not feel.... People are stuffed
with appreciation in our art galleries, instead of
looking at pictures for the fun of it."</p>

<p>Those who take in art for the fun of it, and
don't fake their sensations, acquire an appetite
that it is a great treat to satisfy. And by and by,
art becomes as necessary to them as breathing
fresh air.</p>

<p>To the rest of us, art is only a luxury: a
dessert, not a food.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some poets have to struggle with a harsh
world for leave to be poets, like unlucky peaches
trying to ripen north of Latitude 50. Coventry
Patmore by contrast was bred in a hot-house.
He was the son of a man named Peter G. Patmore,
who, unlike most fathers, was willing to
have a poet in the family. In fact he was eager.
He was also, unfortunately, helpful, and did all
he could to develop in his son "an ardor for
poetry." But ardor is born, not cooked. A
watched pot never boils. Nor did Patmore. He
had many of the other good qualities that all
poets need, but the quality Peter G. planned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
develop in the boy never grew. Young Patmore
studied the best Parnassian systems, he obeyed
the best rules, he practiced the right spiritual
calisthenics, took his dumb-bells out daily: but he
merely proved that poetry is not the automatic
result of going through even the properest motions
correctly.</p>

<p>Still he kept on, year by year, and the results
were impressive. Many respected them highly.
Including their author.</p>

<p>He grew old in this remarkable harness. Perhaps
he also grew tired. At any rate, at sixty-three
he "solemnly recorded" the fact that he
had finally finished "his task as a poet." He lived
for about ten years more, but the remainder was
silence. "He had been a practicing poet for forty-seven
years," Edmund Gosse says. Odd way for
Gosse to talk: as though he were describing a
dentist.</p>

<p>One of this worthy Mr. Patmore's most worthy
ideas was that the actual writing of verse was but
a part of his job. Not even professional poets,
he felt, should make it their chief occupation.
No; one ought to spend months, maybe years,
meditating on everything, in order to supply his
soul with plenty of suitable thoughts&mdash;like a
tailor importing fine woolens to accumulate stock.
And even with the shelves full, one ought not to
work till just the right hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>His theories called for a conscientious inspection
of each inspiration. They also obliged
this good gentleman to exercise self-control.
Many a time when he wanted to work he held
back. Although "the intention to write was
never out of his mind" (Mr. Gosse says), Mr.
Patmore had "the power of will to refuse himself
the satisfaction of writing, except on those rare
occasions when he felt capable of doing his best."</p>

<p>There once was a man I knew, who wooed his
fiancée on those terms. He used to sit thinking
away in his library, evenings, debating
whether he had better go see her, and whether he
was at his best. And after fiddling about in a
worried way between yes and no, he would sometimes
go around only to find that she would not
see <i>him</i>. I think that she loved the man, too, or
was ready to love him. "His honesty has a horrible
fascination for me," I remember her saying,
"but when he has an impulse to kiss me&mdash;and I
see him stop&mdash;and look as though he were taking
his temperature with a thermometer first, trying
to see if his blood is up&mdash;I want to hit him and
scream!"</p>

<p>Mr. Patmore, however, was very firm about
this being necessary. He had many a severe inner
struggle because of his creed. He would repulse
the most enticing inspiration, if his thermometer
wasn't at just the right figure. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he nor his inspirations were robust, but they were
evenly matched, and
they must have wrestled
obstinately and
often in the course of
his life, and pushed
each other about and
exchanged slaps and
tense bloodless pinches.
But whenever Mr.
Patmore felt it his duty
to wrestle, he won.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ill_048.png" width="220" height="236" alt="He took his temperature first" title="He took his temperature first" />
<span class="caption">He took his temperature first</span>
</div>

<p>Consequently, looking backward he felt able
to say when he was old: "I have written little, but
it is all my best; I have never spoken when I had
nothing to say, nor spared time nor labor to make
my words true. I have respected posterity, and
should there be a posterity which cares for letters,
I dare to hope that it will respect me."</p>

<p>That last phrase has a manly ring. Imagine
him, alone late at night, trying to sum up his life,
and placing before us what bits he had managed
to do before dying. We may live through some
evening of that sort ourselves, by and by. We
may turn to look back at the new faces of the
young men and women who will some day be inheriting
our world as we go out its gate. Will
they laugh at us and think us pompous, as some
of us regard Mr. Patmore? He doesn't seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
very hopeful, by the way, about our caring for
letters, but he does seem to think, if we do, that
we will not make fun of him.</p>

<p>I don't think he ought to mind that, though,
if we are friendly about it. We certainly respect
him compared with many men of his time&mdash;the
shifty politicians, the vicious or weak leaders of
thought, who went through life as softies, without
rigid standards of conduct. He shines out by
contrast, this incorruptible, solemn old Roman.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;he was so solemn! "From childhood
to the grave" he thought he had "a mission
to perform," with his poems. And what was this
mission that he was so determined to fill? "He
believed himself to be called upon to celebrate
Nuptial Love."</p>

<p>Again it is his solemnity one smiles at, but
not his idea. Nuptial Love? Very good. The
possibilities of episodic love have been hotly explored,
its rights have been defended, its spiritual
joys have been sung. But Nuptial Love, our queer
breed of humans, inconstant at heart, believes to
be a tame thing by contrast: nearly all anti-climax.
There are delights at the beginning, and a
gentle glow (perhaps) at the end: for the rest it
is a long dusty journey of which the less said the
better. Exceptional couples who do somewhat
better than this, and not only get along without
storms but live contentedly too, are apt to congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
themselves and call their lives a success.
Contentedly! Pah! Content with mere absence
of friction! No conception, apparently, of the
depths beyond depths two should find, who devote
themselves deeply to each other for all of their
lives. I don't say this often is possible: I think
people try: but one or the other comes up against
a hard place and stops. Only, sometimes it's not
that which prevents going further; it's a waywardness
that will not stick to any one mine to
get gold. A man slips away and runs about, picking
up stray outcroppings, but loses the rich veins
of metal, far down in the earth.</p>

<p>Why is it that so few of us contentedly stick to
one mate, and say to ourselves, "Here is my
treasure; I will seek all in her."</p>

<p>Well, this is a subject on which I should enjoy
speculating&mdash;but Nuptial Love happens to be
a field in which I have had no experience, and furthermore
it is not my theme anyhow, but my
friend Mr. Patmore's, whose spirit has been
standing indignantly by, as I wrote, as though it
were ordering me away, with a No Trespassing
look. I will therefore withdraw, merely adding
that he himself didn't do any too well with it.</p>

<p>However, no poet can avoid an occasional
slump. For all Mr. Patmore's efforts, he needs
to be edited as much as the rest of them. Some
of his little chance sayings were taking and odd:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How strange a thing a lover seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To animals that do not love."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he always fell back into being humdrum
and jog-trot. Take this stanza, from his poetical
flight entitled Tamerton Church Tower:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I mounted, now, my patient nag,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And scaled the easy steep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon beheld the quiet flag<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Lanson's solemn Keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he was writing jokes for Punch;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So I, who knew him well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deciding not to stay for lunch,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Returned to my hotel."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>May I ask why such verses should be enshrined
in a standard collection of poetry?
The last four lines are good, they have a touch of
humor or lightness, perhaps; but what can be said
for the first four? And they, only, are Patmore's.
The last four I added myself, in an effort
to help.</p>

<p>"A man may mix poetry with prose as much
as he pleases, and it will only elevate and enliven,"
as Landor observed; "but the moment he
mixes a particle of prose with his poetry, it precipitates
the whole."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>All but the vulgar like poetry. This is
using vulgarity in the sense in which Iva Jewel
Geary defines it, as being "in its essence the acceptance
of life as low comedy, and the willingness
to be entertained by it always, as such.
Whereas poetry," she says, "is the interpretation
of life as serious drama: a play, in the main dignified
and beautiful, or tragic."</p>

<p>Some readers take to poetry as to music, because
it enraptures the ear. Others of us feel a
need for its wisdom and insight&mdash;and wings. It
deepens our everyday moods. It reminds us of
Wonder. Here we are, with our great hearts
and brains, descended from blind bits of slime,
erecting a busy civilization on a beautiful earth;
and that earth is whirling through space, amid
great golden worlds: and yet, being grandsons
of slime, we forget to look around us.</p>

<p>As Patmore expressed it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"An idle poet, here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looks round him; but, for all the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, unfathomably fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is duller than a witling's jest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love wakes men, once a lifetime each;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They lift their heavy lids, and look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lo, what one sweet page can teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They read with joy, then shut the book."<br /></span>

<h2>Legs vs. Architects</h2>


<p>I don't know how many persons who hate
climbing there are in the world; there must be,
by and large, a great number. I'm one, I know
that. But whenever a building is erected for
the use of the public, the convenience of a non-climbing
person is wholly ignored.</p>

<p>I refer, of course, to the debonair habit
which architects have of never designing an entrance
that is easy to enter. Instead of leaving
the entrance on the street level so that a
man can walk in, they perch it on a flight of
steps, so that no one can get in without climbing.</p>

<p>The architect's defense is, it looks better.
Looks better to whom? To architects, and
possibly to tourists who never go in the building.
It doesn't look better to the old or the lame, I
can tell you; nor to people who are tired and
have enough to do without climbing steps.</p>

<p>There are eminent scholars in universities,
whose strength is taxed daily, because they must
daily climb a parapet to get to their studies.</p>

<p>Everywhere there are thousands of men and
women who must work for a living where some
nonchalant architect has needlessly made their
work harder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>I admit there is a dignity and beauty in a long
flight of steps. Let them be used, then, around
statues and monuments, where we don't have to
mount them. But why put them where they
add, every day, to the exertions of every one, and
bar out some of the public completely? That's
a hard-hearted beauty.</p>

<p>Suppose that, in the eye of an architect, it
made buildings more beautiful to erect them on
poles, as the lake dwellers did, ages back. (It
would be only a little more obsolete than putting
them on top of high steps.) Would the public
meekly submit to this standard and shinny up
poles all their lives?</p>

<p>Let us take the situation of a citizen who is
not a mountaineering enthusiast. He can command
every modern convenience in most of his
ways. But if he happens to need a book in the
Public Library what does he find? He finds
that some architect has built the thing like a
Greek temple. It is mounted on a long flight of
steps, because the Greeks were all athletes.
He tries the nearest university library. It has a
flight that's still longer. He says to himself
(at least I do), "Very well, then, I'll buy the
damn book." He goes to the book-stores
They haven't it. It is out of stock, out of print.
The only available copies are those in the libraries,
where they are supposed to be ready for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
one's use; and would be, too, but for the architects
and their effete barricades.</p>

<p>This very thing happened to me last winter.
I needed a book. As I was unable to climb
into the Public Library, I asked one of my friends
to go. He was a young man whose legs had not
yet been worn out and ruined by architects. He
reported that the book I wanted was on the reference
shelves, and could not be taken out. If I
could get in, I could read it all I wanted to, but
not even the angels could bring it outside to me.</p>

<p>We went down there and took a look at the
rampart which would have to be mounted. That
high wall of steps! I tried with his assistance to
climb them, but had to give up.</p>

<p>He said there was a side entrance. We went
there, but there, too, we found steps.</p>

<p>"After you once get inside, there is an elevator,"
the doorkeeper said.</p>

<p>Isn't that just like an architect! To make
everything inside as perfect as possible, and then
keep you out!</p>

<p>There's a legend that a lame man once tried
to get in the back way. There are no steps there,
hence pedestrians are not admitted. It's a delivery
entrance for trucks. So this man had himself
delivered there in a packing case, disguised as the
Memoirs of Josephine, and let them haul him
all the way upstairs before he revealed he was
not. But it seems they turn those cases upside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
down and every which way in handling them, and
he had to be taken to the hospital. He said it
was like going over Niagara.</p>

<p>If there must be a test imposed on every
one who enters a library, have a brain test, and
keep out all readers who are weak in the head.
No matter how good their legs are, if their brains
aren't first-rate, keep 'em out. But, instead, we
impose a leg test, every day of the year, on all
comers. We let in the brainless without any
examination at all, and shut out the most scholarly
persons unless they have legs like an antelope's.</p>

<p>If an explorer told us of some tribe that did
this, we'd smile at their ways, and think they had
something to learn before they could call themselves
civilized.</p>

<p>There are especially lofty steps built around
the Metropolitan Museum, which either repel or
tire out visitors before they get in. Of those
who do finally arrive at the doors, up on top,
many never have enough strength left to view the
exhibits. They just rest in the vestibule awhile,
and go home, and collapse.</p>

<p>It is the same way with most of our churches,
and half of our clubs. Why, they are even beginning
to build steps in front of our great railway
stations. Yes, that is what happens when railway
men trust a "good" architect. He designs something
that will make it more difficult for people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
travel, and will discourage them and turn them
back if possible at the start of their journey. And
all this is done in the name of art. Why can't art
be more practical?</p>

<p>There's one possible remedy:</p>

<p>No architect who had trouble with his own
legs would be so inconsiderate. His trouble is, unfortunately,
at the other end. Very well, break
his legs. Whenever we citizens engage a new
architect to put up a building, let it be stipulated
in the contract that the Board of Aldermen
shall break his legs first. The only objection
I can think of is that his legs would soon get
well. In that case, elect some more aldermen
and break them again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h2>Sex, Religion and Business</h2>


<p>A young Russian once, in the old nineteenth
century days, revisited the town he was born in,
and took a look at the people. They seemed
stupid&mdash;especially the better classes. They had
narrow-minded ideas of what was proper and
what wasn't. They thought it wasn't proper to
love, except in one prescribed way. They worried
about money, and social position and customs.
The young Russian was sorry for them; he felt
they were wasting their lives. His own way of
regarding the earth was as a storehouse of treasures&mdash;sun,
air, great thoughts, great experiences,
work, friendship and love. And life was our one
priceless chance to delight in all this. I don't say
he didn't see much more to life than enjoyment,
but he did believe in living richly, and not starving
oneself.</p>

<p>The people he met, though, were starving themselves
all the time. Certain joys that their natures
desired they would not let themselves have, because
they had got in the habit of thinking them
wrong.</p>

<p>Well, of course this situation is universal; it's
everywhere. Most men and women have social
and moral ideas which result in their starving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
natures. If they should, well and good. But if
not, it is a serious and ridiculous matter. It's especially
hard upon those who don't see what they
are doing.</p>

<p>I know in my own case that I have been
starved, more than once. I'm not starved at the
moment; but I'm not getting all I want either. So
far as the great joys of life go, I live on a diet.
And when something reminds me what splendors
there may be, round the corner, I take a look out
of the door and begin to feel restless. I dream I
see life passing by, and I reach for my hat.</p>

<p>But a man like myself doesn't usually go at all
far. His code is too strong&mdash;or his habits.
Something keeps the door locked. Most of us
are that way; we aren't half as free as we seem.
When a man has put himself into prison it is
hard to get out.</p>

<p>To go back to this Russian, he was in a novel
of Artzibashef's, called Sanine. I thought at first
that he might release me from my little jail. But
it is an odd thing: we victims get particular about
being freed. We're unwilling to be released by
just any one: it must be the right man. It's too
bad to look a savior in the mouth, but it is highly
important. This man Sanine, for instance, was
for letting me out the wrong door.</p>

<p>I didn't see this at the start. In fact I felt
drawn to him. I liked his being silent and caustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and strong in his views. The only thing was,
he kept getting a little off-key. There was a mixture
of wrongness in his rightness that made me
distrust him.</p>

<p>Sanine was in his twenties, and in order to get
all the richness that his nature desired, he had to
attend to his urgent sexual needs. He wasn't in
love, but his sexual needs had to be gratified. In
arranging for this he recognized few or no moral
restrictions. His idea was that people were apt to
make an awful mistake when they tried to build
permanent relations out of these fleeting pleasures.
Even if there were babies.</p>

<p>These views didn't commend themselves to
some of Sanine's neighbors and friends, or to
that narrow village. They believed in family-life,
and in marrying, and all that kind of thing,
and they got no fun at all out of having illegitimate
children. They had a lot of prejudices,
those people. Sanine gave them a chill. Among
them was a young man named Yourii; he's the villain
of this book. He was not wicked, but stupid,
poor fellow. He was pure and proud of it. I
hardly need state that he came to a very bad end.
And when they urged Sanine, who was standing
there at Yourii's burial, to make some little
speech, he replied: "What is there to say? One
fool less in the world." This made several
people indignant, and the funeral broke up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>A friend of Sanine's named Ivanoff, went
with him to the country one day, and they passed
some girls bathing in a stream
there, without any bathing
suits.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/ill_063.png" width="215" height="293" alt="He was pure and
proud of it" title="He was pure and proud of it" />
<span class="caption">He was pure and
proud of it</span>
</div>

<p>"Let's go and look at
them," suggested Sanine.</p>

<p>"They would see us."</p>

<p>"No they wouldn't. We
could land there, and go
through the reeds."</p>

<p>"Leave them alone," said
Ivanoff, blushing slightly.... "They're girls ...
young ladies.... I don't think it's quite proper."</p>

<p>"You're a silly fool," laughed Sanine. "Do
you mean to say that you wouldn't like to see
them? What man wouldn't do the same if he
had the chance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but if you reason like that, you ought
to watch them openly. Why hide yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because it's much more exciting."</p>

<p>"I dare say, but I advise you not to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For chastity's sake, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"But chastity is the very thing that we don't
possess."</p>

<p>Ivanoff smiled, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Look here, my boy," said Sanine, steering
toward the bank, "if the sight of girls bathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
were to rouse in you no carnal desire, then you
would have the right to be called chaste. Indeed
though I should be the last to imitate it, such chastity
on your part would win my admiration. But,
having these natural desires, if you attempt to
suppress them, then I say that your so-called chastity
is all humbug."</p>

<p>This was one of the incidents that made me
dislike Mr. Sanine. I liked his being honest, and
I liked his being down on prudery and humbug.
But I thought his theory of life was a good deal
too simple. "Don't repress your instincts," he
said. That's all very well, but suppose a man has
more than one kind? If a cheap peeping instinct
says "Look," and another instinct says "Oh, you
bounder," which will you suppress? It comes
down to a question of values. Life holds moments
for most of us which the having been a
bounder will spoil.</p>

<p>The harmonizing of body and spirit and all
the instincts into one, so we'll have no conflicting
desires, is an excellent thing&mdash;when we do it;
and we can all do it some of the time, with the will
and the brains to. But no one can, all the time.
And when you are not fully harmonized, and hence
feel a conflict&mdash;different parts of your nature
desiring to go different ways&mdash;why, what can
you do? You must just take your choice of
repressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>As to Sanine, his life is worth reading, and&mdash;in
spots&mdash;imitating. But I thought he was rather
a cabbage. A cabbage is a strong, healthy vegetable,
honest and vigorous. It's closely in touch
with nature, and it doesn't pretend to be what it
isn't. You might do well to study a cabbage: but
not follow its program. A cabbage has too much
to learn. How our downright young moderns
will learn things, I'm sure I don't know. Sanine
scornfully says "not by repression." Well, I
don't think highly of repressions; they're not the
best method. Yet it's possible that they might
be just the thing&mdash;for a cabbage.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Long before Sanine was born&mdash;in the year
1440 in fact&mdash;there was a man in India who
used to write religious little songs. Name of Kabir.
I tried to read his books once, but couldn't,
not liking extremes. He was pretty ecstatic. I
could no more keep up with him than with Sanine.</p>

<p>In his private life Kabir was a married man
and had several children. By trade he was a
weaver. Weaving's like knitting: it allows you to
make a living and think of something else at the
same time. It was the very thing for Kabir, of
course. Gave him practically the whole day to
make songs in, and think of religion. He seems
to have been a happy fellow&mdash;far more so than
Sanine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Sanine's comment would have been that Kabir
was living in an imaginary world, not a real one,
and that he was
autointoxicating himself
with his dreamings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/ill_066.png" width="230" height="285" alt="I couldn&#39;t keep up with Kabir" title="I couldn&#39;t keep up with Kabir" />
<span class="caption">I couldn&#39;t keep up with Kabir</span>
</div>

<p>Kabir's answer
would have been that
Sanine ought to try
that world before
judging it, and had
better begin by just
loving people a little.
More love, and more
willingness to deal
with his poor fellow-creatures, instead of flinging
them off in impatience&mdash;that would have been Kabir's
prescription. And, as a fact, it might really
have been an eye-opener for Sanine.</p>

<p>Of the two, however, I preferred Sanine to
Kabir. The trouble with Kabir was, he wouldn't
let you alone. He wanted everybody to be as
religious as he was: it would make them so
happy, he thought. This made him rather
screechy.</p>

<p>He sang some songs, however, that moved me.
Like many a modern, I'm not religious; that is,
I've no creed; but I don't feel quite positive that
this army of planets just happened, and that man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
evolution from blindness to thought was an accident
and that nowhere is any Intelligence vaster
than mine.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'm always hoping to win some real
spiritual insight. It has come to other men without
dogma (I can't accept dogmas) and so, I keep
thinking, it may some day come to me, too. I
never really expect it next week, though. It's
always far off. It might come, for instance, I
think, in the hour of death. And here is the
song Kabir sang to all men who think that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>O Friend! hope for Him whilst you</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>live, know whilst you live, understand</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>whilst you live; for in life deliverance</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>abides.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>If your bonds be not broken whilst</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>living, what hope of deliverance in death?</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>It is but an empty dream, that the soul</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>shall have union with Him because it has</i><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<i>If He is found now, He is found then.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2">"<i>If you have union now, you shall have</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>it hereafter.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Both Sanine and Kabir should have read
Tarkington's novel, The Turmoil, which is all
about the rush and hustle-bustle of life in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
It would have made them see what great contrasts
exist in this world. Kabir thought too much about
religion. Sanine, of sex. Nobody in The Turmoil
was especially troubled with either. Some
went to church, maybe, and sprinkled a little
religion here and there on their lives; but none
deeply felt it, or woke up in the morning thinking
about it, or allowed it to have much say when
they made their decisions. And as to sex, though
there were lovers among them, it was only
incidentally that they cared about that. They
satisfied nature in a routine way, outside office hours.
No special excitement about it. Nothing hectic&mdash;or
magical.</p>

<p>Now, sex is a fundamental state and concern
of existence: it's a primary matter. If it's pushed
to one side, we at least should be careful what does
it. And religion, too, God or no God, is a
primary matter, if we stretch the word to cover all
the spiritual gropings of man. Yet what is it that
pushes these two great things aside in America?
What makes them subordinate? Business. We
put business first.</p>

<p>And what is this business? What is the
charm of this giant who engrosses us so? In
Tarkington's novel you find yourself in a town of
neighborly people, in the middle west somewhere;
a leisurely and kindly place&mdash;home-like,
it used to be called.    But in the hearts of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
people was implanted a longing for size. They
wished that town to grow. So it did. (We can
all have our wishes.) And with its new bigness
came an era of machinery and rush. "The streets
began to roar and rattle, the houses to tremble,
the pavements were worn under the tread of
hurrying multitudes. The old, leisurely, quizzical
look of the faces was lost in something harder and
warier."</p>

<p>"You don't know what it means, keepin' property
together these days," says one of them. "I
tell you when a man dies the wolves come out of
the woods, pack after pack ... and if that dead
man's children ain't on the job, night and day,
everything he built'll get carried off.... My
Lord! when I think of such things coming to
<i>me</i>! It don't seem like I deserved it&mdash;no man
ever tried harder to raise his boys right than I
have. I planned and planned and planned how
to bring 'em up to be guards to drive the wolves
off, and how to be builders to build, and build
bigger.... What's the use of my havin' worked
my life and soul into my business, if it's all goin'
to be dispersed and scattered, soon as I'm in the
ground?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Poor old business! It does look pretty sordid.
Yet there is a soul in this giant. Consider its
power to call forth the keenness in men and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
give endless zest to their toil and sharp trials to
their courage. It is grimy, shortsighted, this
master&mdash;but it has greatness, too.</p>

<p>Only, as we all know, it does push so much
else to one side! Love, spiritual gropings, the
arts, our old closeness to nature, the independent
outlook and disinterested friendships of men&mdash;all
these must be checked and diminished, lest they
interfere. Yet those things are life; and big business
is just a great game. Why play any game so
intently we forget about life?</p>

<p>Well, looking around at mankind, we see some
races don't. The yellow and black&mdash;and some
Latins. But Normans and Saxons and most
Teutons play their games hard. Knight-errantry
was once the game. See how hard they played
that. The Crusades, too,&mdash;all gentlemen were
supposed to take in the Crusades. Old, burly,
beef-crunching wine-bibbers climbed up on their
chargers and went through incredible troubles and
dangers&mdash;for what? Why, to rescue a shrine,
off in Palestine, from the people who lived there.
Those people, the Saracens, weren't doing anything
very much to it; but still it was thought that
no gentleman ought to stay home, or live his life
normally, until that bit of land had been rescued,
and put in the hands of stout prelates instead of
those Saracans.</p>

<p>Then came the great game of exploring new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lands and new worlds. Cortez, Frobisher, Drake.
Imagine a dialogue in those days between father
and son, a sea-going father who thought exploration
was life, and a son who was weakly and didn't
want to be forced into business. "I don't like exploration
much, Father. I'm seasick the whole
time, you know; and I can't bear this going ashore
and oppressing the blacks." "Nonsense, boy!
This work's got to be done. Can't you see, my
dear fellow, those new countries <i>must</i> be explored?
It'll make a man of you."</p>

<p>So it goes, so it goes. And playing some
game well <i>is</i> needful, to make a man of you. But
once in a while you get thinking it's not quite
enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2>Objections to Reading</h2>

<p>When I was a child of tender years&mdash;about
five tender years, I think&mdash;I felt I couldn't wait
any longer: I wanted to read. My parents had
gone along supposing that there was no hurry;
and they were quite right; there wasn't. But I
was impatient. I couldn't wait for people to read
to me&mdash;they so often were busy, or they insisted
on reading the wrong thing, or stopping too soon.
I had an immense curiosity to explore the book-universe,
and the only way to do it satisfactorily
was to do it myself.</p>

<p>Consequently I got hold of a reader, which
said, "See the Dog Run!" It added, "The Dog
Can Run and Leap," and stated other curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
facts. "The Apple is Red," was one of them, I
remember, and "The Round Ball Can Roll."</p>

<p>There was certainly nothing thrilling about
the exclamation, "See the Dog Run!" Dogs run
all the time. The performance was too common
to speak of. Nevertheless, it did thrill me to spell
it out for myself in a book. "The Round Ball
Can Roll," said my book. Well, I knew that
already. But it was wonderful to have a book
say it. It was having books talk to me.</p>

<p>Years went on, and I read more and more.
Sometimes, deep in Scott, before dinner, I did not
hear the bell, and had to be hunted up by some one
and roused from my trance. I hardly knew where
I was, when they called me. I got up from my
chair not knowing whether it was for dinner or
breakfast or for school in the morning. Sometimes,
late at night, even after a long day of
play&mdash;those violent and never-pausing exertions
that we call play, in boyhood&mdash;I would still try to
read, hiding the light, until my eyes closed in spite
of me. So far as I knew, there were not many
books in the world; but nevertheless I was in a
hurry to read all there were.</p>

<p>In this way, I ignorantly fastened a habit upon
me. I got like an alcoholic, I could let no
day go by without reading. As I grew older, I
couldn't pass a book-shop without going in. And
in libraries, where reading was free, I always read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to excess. The people around me glorified the
habit (just as old songs praise drinking). I
never had the slightest suspicion that it might be a
vice. I was as complacent over my book totals as
six bottle men over theirs.</p>

<span class="caption">Ak and the striped Wumpit&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p>Can there ever have been a race of beings on
some other star, so fascinated as we are by reading?
It is a remarkable appetite. It seems to me
that it must be peculiar to simians. Would you
find the old folks of any other species, with tired
old brains, feeling vexed if they didn't get a whole
newspaper fresh every morning? Back in primitive
times, when men had nothing to read but
knots in a string, or painful little pictures on birch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bark&mdash;was it the same even then? Probably Mrs.
Flint-Arrow, 'way back in the Stone Age pored
over letters from her son, as intensely as any one.
"Only two knots in it this time," you can almost
hear her say to her husband. "Really I
think Ak might be a little more frank with his
mother. Does it mean he has killed that striped
Wumpit in Double Rock Valley, or that the Gouly
family where you told him to visit has twins?"</p>

<span class="caption">maiden in

</div>

<p>There are one or two primitive ideas we still
have about reading. I remember in a boarding-house
in Tucson, I once met a young clergyman,
who exemplified the belief many have in the power
of books. "Here are you," he would say to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
"and here is your brain. What are you going to
put into it? That is the question." I could
make myself almost as good as a bishop, he intimated,
by choosing the noblest and best books, instead
of mere novels. One had only to choose
the right sort of reading to be the right sort of
man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_078.png" width="500" height="276" alt="Scenes of Horror" title="Scenes of Horror" />
<span class="caption">Scenes of Horror</span>
</div>

<p>He seemed to think I had only to read Socrates
to make myself wise, or G. Bernard Shaw to
be witty.</p>

<p>Cannibals eat the hearts of dead enemy chieftains,
to acquire their courage; and this clergyman
entered a library with the same simple notion.</p>

<p>But though books are weak implements for
implanting good qualities in us, they do color our
minds, fill them with pictures and sometimes ideas.
There are scenes of horror in my mind to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that were put there by Poe, or Ambrose Bierce
or somebody, years ago, which I cannot put out.
No maiden in distress would bother me nowadays,
I have read of too many, but some of those first
ones I read of still make me feel cold. Yes, a
book can leave indelible pictures .... And it can
introduce wild ideas. Take a nice old lady for instance,
at ease on her porch, and set the ballads of
Villon to grinning at her over the hedge, or a deep-growling
Veblen to creeping on her, right down
the rail,&mdash;it's no wonder they frighten her. She
doesn't want books to show her the underworld
and blacken her life.</p>

<span class="caption">Dastardly attack by Veblen&#39;s latest.</span>
</div>

<p>It's not surprising that some books are censored
and forbidden to circulate. The surprising
thing is that in this illiberal world they travel so
freely. But they usually aren't taken seriously; I
suppose that's the answer. It's odd. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
countries that won't admit even the quietest living
man without passports will let in the most active,
dangerous thoughts in book form.</p>

<p>The habit of reading increases. How far can
it go? The innate capacity of our species for
it is plainly enormous. Are we building a race of
men who will read several books every day, not
counting a dozen newspapers at breakfast, and
magazines in between? It sounds like a lot, but
our own record would have astonished our ancestors.
Our descendants are likely to read
more and faster than we.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_080.png" width="500" height="312" alt="The Underworld" title="The Underworld" />
<span class="caption">The Underworld</span>
</div>

<p>People used to read chiefly for knowledge or
to pursue lines of thought. There wasn't so much
fiction as now. These proportions have changed.
We read some books to feed our curiosity but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more to feed our emotions. In other words, we
moderns are substituting reading for living.</p>

<p>When our ancestors felt restless they burst
out of their poor bookless homes, and roamed
around looking for adventure. We read some
one else's. The only adventures they could find
were often unsatisfactory, and the people they
met in the course of them were hard to put up
with. We can choose just the people and adventures
we like in our books. But our ancestors
got real emotions, where we live on canned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Volume of morbid Geography
attempting to enter Lone Gulch</span>
</div>

<p>Of course canned emotions are thrilling at
times, in their way, and wonderful genius has gone
into putting them up. But a man going home
from a library where he has read of some battle,
has not the sensations of a soldier returning from
war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Still&mdash;for us&mdash;reading is natural. If we
were more robust, as a race, or if earth-ways
were kinder, we should not turn so often to books
when we wanted more life. But a fragile yet
aspiring species on a stormy old star&mdash;why, a
substitute for living is the very thing such beings
need.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><br />

<h2>The Enjoyment of Gloom</h2>

<img src="images/ill_086.png" width="220" height="387" alt="The Enjoyment of Gloom" title="The Enjoyment of Gloom" />
</div>

<p>There used to be a
poem&mdash;I wish I could find
it again&mdash;about a man in a
wild, lonely place who had
a child and a dog. One
day he had to go somewhere
So he left the dog
home to protect the child
until he came back. The
dog was a strong, faithful
animal, with large, loving
eyes.</p>

<p>Something terrible happened
soon after the man
had gone off. I find I'm
rather hazy about it, but I think it was wolves.
The faithful dog had an awful time of it. He
fought and he fought. He was pitifully cut up
and bitten. In the end, though, he won.</p>

<p>The man came back when it was night. The
dog was lying on the bed with the child he had
saved. There was blood on the bed. The man's
heart stood still. "This blood is my child's,"
he thought hastily, "and this dog, which I trusted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
has killed it." The dog feebly wagged his tail.
The man sprang upon him and slew him.</p>

<p>He saw his mistake immediately afterward,
but&mdash;it was too late.</p>

<p>When I first read this I was a boy of perhaps
ten or twelve. It darn near made me cry.
There was one line especially&mdash;the poor dog's
dying howl of reproach. I think it did make me
cry.</p>

<p>I at once took the book&mdash;a large, blue one&mdash;and
hunted up my younger brothers. I made
them sit one on each side of the nursery fire.
"I'm going to read you something," I said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_087.png" width="500" height="373" alt="&quot;Keep all the wolves out now.&quot;" title="&quot;Keep all the wolves out now.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Keep all the wolves out now.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked up at me trustfully. I remember
their soft, chubby faces.</p>

<p>I began the poem, very much moved; and they
too, soon grew agitated. They had a complete
confidence, however, that it would come out all
right. When it didn't, when the dog's dying
howl came, they burst into tears. We all sobbed
together.</p>

<span class="caption">Reading about the poor dog.</span>
</div>

<p>This session was such a success that I read it
to them several times afterward. I didn't get
quite so much poignancy out of these encores myself
but my little brothers cried every time, and
that, somehow, gave me pleasure. It gave no
pleasure to them. They earnestly begged me
not to keep reading it. I was the eldest, however,
and paid little attention, of course, to their
wishes. They'd be playing some game, perhaps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I would stalk into the room, book in hand, and
sit them down by the fire. "You're going to read
us about the dog again?" they would wail. "Well,
not right away," I'd say. "I'll read something
funny to start with." This didn't much
cheer them. "Oh, please don't read us about the
dog, please don't," they'd beg, "we're playing
run-around." When I opened the book they'd begin
crying 'way in advance, long before that
stanza came describing his last dying howl.</p>

<p>It was kind of mean of me.</p>

<p>There's a famous old author, though, who's
been doing just that all his life. He's eighty
years old, and still at it. I mean Thomas
Hardy. Dying howls, of all kinds, are his
specialty.</p>

<p>His critics have assumed that from this they
can infer his philosophy. They say he believes
that "sorrow is the rule and joy the exception,"
and that "good-will and courage and honesty are
brittle weapons" for us to use in our defense as we
pass through such a world.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I agree that that's Hardy's
philosophy. It's fair enough to say that Hardy's
stories, and still more his poems, paint chiefly
the gloomy and hopeless situations in life, just
as Mark Twain and Aristophanes painted the
comic ones. But Mark Twain was very far from
thinking the world was a joke, and I doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
whether Hardy regards it at heart as so black.</p>

<p>He has written&mdash;how many books? twenty
odd?&mdash;novels and poems. They make quite an
edifice. They represent long years of work.
Could he have been so industrious if he had
found the world a chamber of horrors? He
might have done one or two novels or poems
about it, but how could he have kept on if he had
truly felt the whole thing was hopeless? He
kept on, because although sorrows move him he
does not feel their weight. He found he could
have a good time painting the world's tragic aspects.
He is somehow or other so constituted
that that's been his pleasure. And he has wanted
his own kind of pleasure, just as you and I want
our kinds. That's fair.</p>

<p>I like to think that the good old soul has had a
lot of fun all his life, describing all the gloomiest
episodes a person could think of. If a good,
gloomy episode comes into his mind while he's
shaving, it brightens the whole day, and he
bustles off to set it down, whistling.</p>

<p>Somebody once asked him if he were as pessimistic
as his writings would indicate, and he
replied that it wasn't safe to judge a man's
thoughts by his writings. His writings showed
only what kind of things he liked to describe.
"Some authors become vocal before one aspect of
life, some another." (Perhaps not his exact words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but close to it.) One aspect of life may impress
you, yet leave you in silence; another may stimulate
you into saying something; but what does
that prove? It merely shows what you like best
to talk about, not your philosophy. A cat whose
life is principally peace and good food and warm
fires makes hardly any noise about those things&mdash;at
most a mere purr. But she does become vocal
and wildly so, over midnight encounters. If another
cat so much as disputes her way on a fence-top,
her tragic shrieks of anguish will sound like
the end of the world. Well, Hardy has spent his
life in what was chiefly a peaceful era of history,
in a liberal and prosperous country; and he personally,
too, has had blessings&mdash;the blessing of
being able, for instance, to write really good
books, and the blessing of finding a public to read
and admire them. Is any of this reflected in his
themes, though? Does he purr? Mighty little.
No, he prefers looking around for trouble in
this old world's backyards; he prowls about at
night till he comes upon some good hunk of
bleakness, and then he sits down, like the cat, to
utter long-drawn-out wails, which give him
strange, poignant sensations of deep satisfaction.
They give us quite other sensations but he doesn't
care. In the morning he canters back in, pleased
and happy, for breakfast, and he basks in the
sun, blinking sagely, the rest of the day.    And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
we say, with respect, "A great pessimist; he
thinks life is all sorrow."</p>

<p>The principal objection to pessimists is they
sap a man's hope. As some English writer has
said, there are two kinds of hope. First, the
hope of success, which gives men daring, and
helps them win against odds. That isn't the best
sort of hope. Many deliberately cultivate it because
it makes for success, but that is an insincere
habit; it's really self-hypnotism. It may help us
to win in some particular enterprise, yes; but it's
dangerous, like drug-taking. You must keep on
increasing the dose, and blind-folding your reason.
Men who do it are buoyant, self-confident,
but some of their integrity is lost.</p>

<p>The best kind of hope is not about success in
this or that undertaking. It's far deeper; hence
when things go against you, it isn't destroyed. It
is hope about the nature and future of man and
the universe. It is this hope the pessimists
would disallow. That's why they repel us. Some
lessen our hope in the universe; others, in man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h2>Buffoon Fate</h2>


<p>Suppose that a lot of us were living aboard a
huge ship. Suppose the ship didn't rock much, or
require any urgent attention, but kept along on an
even keel and left us free to do as we liked. And
suppose we got into the habit of staying below
more and more, never coming up on deck or regarding
the sea or the sky. Just played around
below, working at little jobs; eating, starving,
quarreling, and arguing in the hold of that ship.</p>

<p>And then, maybe, something would happen
to call us on deck. Some peril, some storm. And
we'd suddenly realize that our life between decks
wasn't all. We'd run up and rub our eyes, and
stare around at the black waters, the vast, heaving
waves; and a gale from far spaces would strike
us, and chill us like ice. And we'd think, "By
Jove, we're on a ship! And where is our ship
sailing?"</p>

<p>Wars, plagues and famines are the storms that
make us run up on deck. They snatch us up,
out of our buying and selling and studying, and
show us our whole human enterprise as a ship, in
great danger.</p>

<p>We want to scurry back below, where it's
lighted and smaller.    Down below where our toys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
are. On deck it's too vast, too tremendous....</p>

<p>We want to forget that the human race is on
an adventure, sailing no one knows where, on a
magical, treacherous sea.</p>

<p>We have fought our way up from being wild,
houseless lemurs, or lower, and little by little we
have built up our curious structure&mdash;of learning,
of art, of discovery&mdash;a wonderful structure: at
least for us monkey-men. It has been a long
struggle. We can guess, looking backward, what
our ancestors had to contend with&mdash;how the cavemen
fought mammoths, and their tough sons and
daughters fought barbarism. But we want to
forget it. We wish every one now to be genial.
We pretend that this isn't the same earth that our
ancestors lived on, but quite a different planet,
where roughness is kept within bounds and where
persons wear gloves and have neat wooden doors
they can lock.</p>

<p>But it's the very same earth that old Grandpa
Caveman once wrestled with, and where old
Grandma Cavewoman ran for her life twice a
week.</p>

<p>We've varnished the surface.</p>

<p>But it's still wild and strange just beneath.</p>

<p>In a book called "The War in the Air," by H.
G. Wells (1907) he pictures the world swimming
along quietly, when bang! a war starts! And it
spreads, and takes in East and West, smashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cities, stops everything. And one of the young
men in the story looks around rather dazed, and
says in a low voice: "I've always thought life
was a lark. It isn't. This sort of thing has always
been happening, I suppose&mdash;these things,
wars and earthquakes, that sweep across all the
decency of life. It's just as though I had woke
up to it all for the first time.... And it's always
been so&mdash; it's the way of life."</p>

<p>So that's what we need to get used to, that
it's <i>that</i> kind of a ship. We ought to have a sense
of the adventure on which we're all bound.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It's not only war&mdash;not by a long shot&mdash;that
gives men that sense. Great scientists have it.
Great sailors. You can sort out the statesmen
around you, the writers, the poets, according to
whether or not they ever have been up on deck.</p>

<p>Theodore Dreiser has, for instance; Arnold
Bennett has not. Charles Dickens did not, and
that's why he is ranked below Thackeray. Compare
James Joyce's "Portrait of the Artist" with
George Moore's "Confessions," and if you apply
this criterion, Moore takes a back seat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There's one great man now living, however,
who has almost too much of this sense: this cosmic
adventure emotion. And that man's Joseph
Conrad. Perhaps in his youth the sea came upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
him too suddenly, or his boyhood sea-dreams awed
too deeply his then unformed mind. At all events,
the men in his stories are like lonely spirits, sailing,
spellbound, through the immense forces surrounding
the world. "There they are," one of
them says, as he stands at the rail, "stars, sun, sea,
light, darkness, space, great waters; the formidable
Work of the Seven Days, into which man
seems to have blundered unbidden. Or else decoyed."</p>

<p>We all have that mood. But Conrad, he's
given to brooding. And his habit at night when
he stands staring up at the stars is to see (or conjure
up rather) a dumb buffoon Fate, primeval,
unfriendly and stupid, whom Man must defy.
And Conrad defies it, but wearily, for he feels
sick at heart,&mdash;because of his surety that Fate
is ignoble, and blind.</p>

<p>It's as though the man told himself ghost
stories about this great universe. He feels that
it ought to have a gracious and powerful master,
leading men along fiery highways to test but not
crush them, and marching them firm-eyed and
glorious toward high goals. But instead there is
nothing. The gray, empty wastes of the skies beyond
starland are silent. Or, worse, their one
sound is the footfall of that buffoon Fate.</p>

<p>The way to meet this black situation, according to Conrad,
is to face it with grim steady courage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
And that's what he does. It's stirring to
discover the fineness of this man's tragic bravery.
But when I get loose from his spell, and reflect, independently,
I ask myself, "After all, is this performance
so brave?"</p>

<p>We must all weigh the universe, each in his own
penny-scales, and decide for ourselves whether
to regard it as inspiring or hollow. But letting
our penny-scales frighten us isn't stout-hearted.</p>

<p>If I were to tell myself ghost stories until I
was trembling, and then, with my heart turning
cold, firmly walk through the dark, my courage
would be splendid, no doubt, but not finely applied.
Conrad's courage is splendid&mdash;it is as great as
almost any modern's&mdash;but it isn't courageous of
him to busy it with self-conjured dreads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>The Wrong Lampman</h2>


<p>It is odd, or no, it's not, but it's note-worthy,
that Shaw has had few disciples. Here is a
witty, vivacious man, successful and keen: why
isn't he the head of a school of other keen, witty
writers? He has provided an attractive form&mdash;the
play with an essay as preface. He has provided
stock characters, such as the handsome-hero male-moth,
who protests so indignantly at the fatal
attraction of candles. He has developed above
all that useful formula which has served many a
dramatist&mdash;the comic confrontation of reason and
instinct in man. Yet this whole apparatus lies
idle, except for the use that Shaw makes of it.
It is as though Henry Ford had perfected an
automobile, and then no one had taken a drive
in it, ever, but Henry.</p>

<p>The explanation that Shaw's is too good a machine,
or that it takes a genius to run it, is not sufficiently
plausible. The truth probably is that his
shiny car has some bad defect.</p>

<p>It has this defect certainly: in all his long
arguments, Shaw has one underlying assumption&mdash;that
men could be perfectly reasonable and wise if
they would. They have only to let themselves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and if they won't, it's downright perversity. This
belief is at the center of his being, and he can't get
away from it. He doesn't hold it lightly: he's
really in earnest about it. Naturally, when he
looks around at the world with that belief in his
heart, and sees men and women making blunders
which he thinks they don't need to, he becomes too
exasperated for silence, and pours out his plays.
Sometimes he is philosophic enough to treat his fellows
amusedly; sometimes he is serious and exacerbated,
in which case he is tiresome. But at
heart he is always provoked and astonished at men
for the way they fend off the millennium, when it's
right at their side.</p>

<p>He may have inherited this attitude from those
economists, who flourished, or attempted to flourish,
in the generation before him&mdash;those who
built with such confidence on rationalism in
human affairs. Man was a reasonable being, they
said and believed; and all would be well with him,
therefore, when he once saw the light. To discover
the light might be difficult, but they would
do all that for us, and then it would surely be no
trouble to man to accept it. They proceeded to
discover the light in finance, trade, and matters of
government; and Shaw, coming after them, extended
the field into marriage, and explained to us
the rational thing to do in social relations. These
numerous doses of what was confidently recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as reason were faithfully swallowed by all
of us; and yet we're not changed. The dose was
as pure as these doctors were able to make it.
But&mdash;reason needs admixtures of other things to
be a good dose. Men have learned that without
these confirmings it's not to be trusted.</p>

<p>The turn that psychology has taken during
the last twenty years has naturally been unlucky
for Shaw as a leader, or influence. He appears
now as the culminating figure of an old school of
thinkers, instead of the founder of a new. And
that old school is dead. It was so fascinated by
reason or what it believed to be such (for we
should not assume that its conceptions, even of
reason, were right), that it never properly studied
or faced human nature.</p>

<p>Civilization is a process, not a trick to be
learned overnight. It is a way of behavior which
we super-animals adopt bit by bit. The surprising
and hopeful thing is that we adopt it at all. Civilization
is the slow modification of our old feral
qualities, the slow growth of others, which we
test, then discard or retain. An occasional invention
seems to hasten things, but chiefly externally;
for the internal change in men's natures is slower
than glaciers, and it is upon the sum of men's
natures that civilization depends. While this testing
and churning and gradual molding goes on,
some fellow is always holding up a hasty lamp he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
calls reason, and beckoning the glacier one side,
like a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>Shaw's lamp of reason is one that has an extra
fine glitter; it makes everything look perfectly
simple; it shows us short-cuts. He recommends
it as a substitute for understanding, which he does
not manufacture. Understanding is slow, and is
always pointing to the longest way round.</p>

<p>Shaw has studied the ways of mankind, but
without enough sympathy. It is unlucky, both for
him and for us, this is so. Sympathy would have
made him humorous and wise, and then what a
friend he'd have been to us. Instead, being brilliant
and witty, he has left us unnourished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Seamy Side of Fabre</h2>


<p>This is an essay on Fabre&mdash;that lovable and
charming old Frenchman who wrote about insects.
<i>I</i> don't say he's lovable, mind you, but that's how
he is always described.</p>

<p>He was one of those fortunate men who are
born with a gift of some sort. His gift was for
interpretation, but it worked well in only one field.
Every animal, vegetable and mineral finds an interpreter,
sooner or later; some man who so loves
them that he understands them and their story,
and finds ways of telling it to the rest of mankind&mdash;if
they'll let him. Fabre was born with a
peculiar understanding of insects.</p>

<p>Even as a baby he was fascinated by grasshoppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and beetles. As a child he wished to
study them far more than anything else. He
should have been encouraged to do this: allowed
to, at any rate. Any child with a gift, even for
beetles, should be allowed to develop it. But this
small boy was born in a place where his gift was
despised; he was torn away from his insects and
put through the mill.</p>

<p>Our great blundering old world is always searching
for learning and riches, and everlastingly
crushing underfoot all new riches and learning.
It tried to make Fabre, a born lover of nature, desert
her; it forced him to teach mathematics for
decades instead. The first thing the world does
to a genius is to make him lose all his youth.</p>

<p>Well, Fabre, after losing his youth, and his
middle age too, and after being duly kept back at
every turn, all his life, by the want of a few extra
francs, finally won out at sixty. That is to say, he
then got a chance to study and write about insects,
in a tiny country home, with an income that was
tinier still. "It is a little late, O my pretty insects,"
he said; "I greatly fear the peach is offered
to me only when I'm beginning to have no teeth
wherewith to eat it."</p>

<p>As it turned out, however, this wasn't true. He
had not only plenty of time, but in my opinion, too
much. He lived to be over ninety and he wrote
and he wrote and he wrote: he wrote more about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
insects than any one man or woman can read. I
consider it lucky that he didn't begin until sixty.</p>

<p>Insects, as every one knows, are the worst
foes of man. Fabre not only studied these implacable
beings but loved them. There was something
unnatural about it; something disloyal to the
whole human race. It is probable that Fabre was
not really human at all. He may have been found
in some human cradle, but he was a changeling.
You can see he has insect blood in him, if you look
at his photograph. He is leathery, agile, dried
up. And his grandmother was waspish. He
himself always felt strangely close to wasps, and
so did wasps to him. I dare say that in addition
to Fabre's "Life of the Wasp," there exists, if
we could only get at it, a wasp's Life of Fabre.</p>

<p>If the wasp wrote as Fabre does, he would
describe Fabre's birth, death, and matings, but
tell us hardly anything else about Fabre's real
life. He would dwell chiefly on Fabre's small
daily habits and his reactions to the wasp's interference.</p>

<p>"Desirous of ascertaining what the old Fabre
would do if stung," writes the wasp, "I repeatedly
stuck my sting in his leg&mdash;but without any effect.
I afterward discovered however I had been stinging
his boots. This was one of my difficulties, to
tell boots and Fabre apart, each having a tough
wizened quality and a powdery taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old Fabre went into his wooden nest
or house after this, and presently sat down to eat
one of his so-called meals. I couldn't see an
atom of dung on the table however, and though
there were some fairly edible flowers he never
once sucked them. He had only an immense
brown root called a potato, and a 'chop' of some
cow. Seizing a prong in his claws, the old Fabre
quickly harpooned this 'chop' and proceeded to
rend it, working his curious mandibles with sounds
of delight, and making a sort of low barking talk
to his mate. Their marriage, to me, seemed unnatural.
Although I watched closely for a week
this mate laid no eggs for him: and instead of saving
food for their larvæ they ate it all up themselves.
How strange that these humans should
differ so much from us wasps!"</p>

<p>Another life of Fabre that we ought to have
is one by his family. <i>They</i> were not devoted to
insects; they probably loathed them; and yet they
had to get up every morning and spend the whole
day nursing bugs. I picture them, yawning and
snarling over the tedious experiments, and listening
desperately to Fabre's coleopterous chatter.
The members of every famous man's family ought
to give us their side of it. I want more about
Tolstoy by Mrs. Tolstoy. And a Life of Milton
by his daughters. That picture of those unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
daughters, looking so sweet and devoted, taking
the blind poet's dictation, is&mdash;must be&mdash;deceptive.
They were probably wanting to go off
upstairs, all the time, and try new ways of doing
their hair; or go out and talk their heads off with
other girls, or look in shop windows: anything but
take down old Mr. Milton's poetry all day. They
didn't know their papa was a classic: they just
thought that he was the longest-winded papa in
their street. I have no warrant for saying this, I
may add. Except that it's human nature....</p>

<p>Fabre has his good points. He is imaginative
and dramatic, and yet has a passion for truth.
He is a philosopher, an artist. And above all he
is not sentimental. He is fond of his insects, but
he never is foolishly fond. And sometimes the
good old soul is as callous as can be toward caterpillars.
He shows no more bowels towards caterpillars
than do his own wasps. Take, for instance,
that experiment when he kept some on the
march for eight days, watching them interestedly
as they died of exhaustion. Or his delight at the
way caterpillars are eaten by the Eumenes wasp.</p>

<p>This wasp shuts its egg up in a large, prison-like
cell, with a pile of live caterpillars beside it,
to serve as its food, first half-paralyzing these
victims so they will keep still. Alive but unable
to move, the caterpillars lie there till the grub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hatches out. (Dead caterpillars wouldn't do
because this little grub loves fresh meat.)</p>

<p>The grub, hanging by a thread from the ceiling,
now begins having dinner. "Head downward
it is digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars,"
says Fabre. "The caterpillars grow restless,"
he adds. (There's a fine brutal touch!)
The grub thereupon, to Fabre's delight, climbs
back up its thread. It is only a baby; it's tender;
and when those wretched caterpillars get to
thrashing around, they might hurt the sweet infant.
Not till "peace" is restored, Fabre adds,
does Baby dare to come down again. Hideous
infantile epicure! It takes another good juicy
bite.</p>

<p>And if its dinner moans again, or wriggles, it
again climbs back up.</p>

<p>Imagine some caterpillar reader shuddering at
this horror&mdash;this lethal chamber where prominent
caterpillars are slowly eaten alive. Yet scenes
like this occur all through Fabre, and are described
with great relish. If he wrote of them in a dry
professional way, it would sound scientific, and I
could read it in a cool, detached spirit with never
a flutter. But he does it so humanly that you get
to be friends with these creatures, and then he
springs some grisly little scene on you that gives
you the creeps, and explains to you that the said
little scene is going on all the time; and it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you feel as though there were nothing but red
fangs in the world.</p>

<p>Fabre at one time was offered the post of
tutor to Napoleon III's son, but he preferred to
live in poverty in the country, where he could keep
up his studies. No money, no honors could tempt
him away from his work. Perhaps this was noble.
But it seems to me he made a mistake. In fact,
this was the greatest and most fatal mistake of
his life.</p>

<p>If he had gone to Napoleon, he might have
moped awhile at first, and felt guilty. But he
would have gone right on loving insects and wanting
to study them. Hence he would have soon
begun looking around the palace for specimens.
And this might have led to his discovering riches
indoors.</p>

<p>Suppose he had written about that bug that
takes its name from our beds, and helped us to understand
its persistent devotion to man. According
to Ealand, the scientist, they are not wholly
bad. They were once supposed to be good for
hysteria if taken internally. The Ancients gave
seven to adults and four to children, he says, "to
cure lethargy." But the best Ealand can do is to
give us bits of information like this, whereas Fabre,
if he had lived in his bedroom, could have
been their interpreter.</p>

<p>That's his failure&mdash;his books are over-weighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with bugs of the fields. I have plowed
through long chapters without getting away for a
minute from beetles. In bugs of the field I take
a due interest (which, I may add, isn't much), but
the need of humanity is to know about bugs of the
home.</p>

<h2>In His Baby Blue Ship</h2>


<p>There are some people who can't enjoy fairy-stories,
and don't like imagining. They are
a bit too hard-headed. I don't blame such
people; they are all right enough in their
way. Only they ought not to go around saying
fairy-stories are silly. They ought simply to
let them alone and live nice hard-headed lives.</p>

<p>It is the same way with soft-headed people who
cannot enjoy the real world. Not having much
taste for it, and not getting on too well in it, they
are apt to call it pretty bad names and to wish it
were different. I think them too hasty. Before
they abuse or advise it they should first understand
it. If they can't, they should let it alone
more, and live in their dreams.</p>

<p>Or in those of such dreamers as Maeterlinck,
Dunsany, or Poe.</p>

<p>The Maeterlinck books constitute quite a beautiful
country. They have long been a favorite
home for our soft-headed friends. And those of
us who are of a compound between hard and soft
enjoy visiting the Maeterlinck coast as we might
a resort. It is pleasantly unreal; it is varied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Gentle breezes of sweetness; blue seas, massive
rocks; and storms too. Here and there a crag,
or dark castle of terrible grandeur. Is it not
picturesque? Don't poke at the castles with
your umbrella; you might go through the tin; but
take it all in the right spirit as you would Coney
Island.</p>

<p>Human nature being what it is, there is certainly
a need for this place.</p>

<p>There is one little difficulty about the situation
however. Monsieur Maeterlinck, the proprietor,
although he makes his home in this region, likes
sometimes to visit the real world, if but for a
change. Well, this would be nothing to object to,
though for him injudicious, but he is such a
stranger there that he does not at all know his
place. He takes himself seriously at his home;
it is natural, I'm sure; but it leads him to speak
in the real world with a voice of authority. He
is not in the least offensive about it, no one could
be more gentle, but he doesn't at all realize that
his rank here permits no such tone. On the Maeterlinck
coast, in the realms of romance, he is
king. In the real world his judgments are not
above those of a child.</p>

<p>It would give me more pleasure (or at any
rate it ought to, I know) to dwell on his many
abilities than on this one fault. But this excellent
man has the misfortune to resemble wood-alcohol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Wood-alcohol is a respectable liquid; it is
useful in varnish; when poured in a lamp it heats
tea; yes, it has its good side. Yet how little we
dwell on its uses, how much on its defect; its one
small defect that it's fatal when taken internally.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck has for years made a business of
beautiful thoughts. With some of them he built
romantic tales that are or were a refreshment.
But others he embodied in sermons addressed to
reality. He told us none needed to go to his coast
for romance, or for purity and beauty and goodness,
for we really were full of them. We were
made in fact of just these ingredients, at least in
our hearts; and it followed, he said, that our actions
should be chosen accordingly. Without
ever having learned anything much of mankind,
he described just the way that he felt all mankind
should behave. He put on the robes of a sage,
and he sweetened his looks, and his voice became
tender and thrilling and rather impressive; and
he wrote about the Treasure of the Humble, and
Wisdom and Destiny.</p>

<p>The real world is not easy to live in. It is
rough; it is slippery. Without the most clear-eyed
adjustments we fall and get crushed. A man
must stay sober: not always, but most of the time.
Those of us who drink from the flasks of the
sages of dreamland become so intoxicated with
guff we are a peril to everyone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>We trust in Hague tribunals for instance, on
the eve of great wars.</p>

<p>The flask that Wood-Alcohol Maurice, if I
may so call him, held so long to our lips in the
years before 1914, produced the usual effects of
joy first, and then blindness and coma. I speak
from experience. I took some myself and was
poisoned, and I knew other cases. But it
poisoned poor Maeterlinck more&mdash;I may say,
most of all&mdash;for he had taken his own medicine
honorably as fast as he mixed it. Owing to this
imprudence, he found himself, in 1914, in such a
deep coma it almost killed him to come out of it.
His anger at having to wake up and face things
was loud. He found himself compelled to live
for a while in the midst of hard facts, and his
comments upon them were scathing; as all dreamers'
are.</p>

<p>Since then he has gone part-way back to the
land of romance, and if he will stay there I shall
not prefer charges against him. He is one of the
masters of fancy. He can mine fairy gold. But
any time he comes to this world we're now learning
to live in, or offers us any more mail-order lessons
in sweetness, I think we should urge him to
go and stay where he belongs.</p>

<p>There is a poem by Joaquin Miller about Columbus
that describes his long voyage. It consists,
as I remember, entirely of groans by the sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
who keep asking Columbus whether he will please
let them turn back. But Columbus never has but
one answer, and that is "Sail on." He says "Sail
on, sail on," over and over again, at the end of
each stanza. I grant you it must have been monotonous
enough to the crew, who after the first
week or two probably knew it by heart; but never
mind, it sounds well to us. It's especially good
when declaimed. I don't suppose Columbus himself
climbed the poop and declaimed it; he merely
stopped shaving, stuck his head out of the
chart-room and screeched it,&mdash;suitably mixed
with whatever profanities his day could command.
But Time, which softens all homely history, has
beautified this. All the boy Columbuses <i>I</i> ever
heard recite it, when I was at school, had as noble
a way as one could ask of telling their crews to
sail on.</p>

<p>I did not mean to make so long a digression.
To get back to Maeterlinck. We ought to provide
him with a beautiful baby-blue ship. Odd,
charming allegorical figures should sit on the
decks, and fenders should hang from the sides to
ward off bumps of truth. Astern he might tow a
small wife-boat, as a mariner should, with its
passenger capacity carefully stamped on the bottom.
And instead of Columbus, a honey-fed spirit
of dream should stand in his prow and adjure
him to sail on, to dreamland. "Dream on, dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
on, dream on," she should patter, each time he
grew restless. I could not take a turn in the
prow myself, it would be too much honor; but I
should be glad to take my stand in the gentleman's
rear, and do all I could to accelerate his progress
from thence.</p>

<h2>The Man Who Knew Gods</h2>


<p>His case illustrated the risks explorers run.
Not the physical risks, which are overestimated,
but the psychological dangers. For years he had
lived among savages, observing their ways, and
owing to this he had fallen into a completely detached
mental habit. When he returned to civilization,
he had become a confirmed looker-on. He
couldn't get back into touch with us. He remained
an outsider.</p>

<p>I met him but once myself. I was in the publishing
business at the time, and, hearing that this
man was in New York, I thought I might as well
see him about his next book. Telephoning him,
therefore, at his hotel, I asked him to dine with me
on the following Friday.</p>

<p>"Fri-day?" he replied. "What is 'Friday'?"
(He spoke English perfectly.)</p>

<p>"It is the twenty-sixth," I answered.</p>

<p>He said: "The twenty-sixth what? Oh, I
know," he continued; "Friday is a day of the
week. Thank you very much, but I do not keep
track of my dinners so carefully as that."</p>

<p>This rather odd answer I passed over, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
moment, thinking I had misunderstood him; and
we arranged that he would come some day to my
office instead, after lunch.</p>

<p>The next that I heard, he had called there at
a quarter to five, the hour at which I always
leave. My secretary explained to him that I had
gone.</p>

<p>He looked at my desk, on which lay some unfinished
business, and said to my secretary,
"Why?"</p>

<p>The man courteously responded, "Because it
is a quarter to five."</p>

<p>The explorer thereat laughed weirdly and
went off.</p>

<p>I now perceived I had to deal with a most eccentric
character; but that being a necessary evil in
the publishing business, I went to his hotel at
nine o'clock that evening. I found him down in
the restaurant eating oatmeal and succotash, and
we then and there had the following extravagant
interview,&mdash;which I give without comment.</p>

<p>"The book <i>I</i> mean to write," he said, staring
at me, "is a study of actual religions. Other
writers have told the world what men of all
countries suppose their religions to be. I shall
tell what they really are."</p>

<p>I said that our house would prefer an account
of his travels; but he paid no attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men's real religions," he announced, "are
unknown to themselves. You may have heard of
the Waam Islanders," he leisurely continued.
"They, for instance, would tell you that their deity
was an idol called Bashwa, a large crumbling stone
thing which stands in a copperwood forest. They
worship this idol most faithfully, on the first of
each lunar month. No Waam Islander would
ever acknowledge he had any other God but
Bashwa.</p>

<p>"But a stranger soon notices that in every hut
and cave in that country, hanging beside the
water-jar, is a long sleeping mat, and on that mat
a rough pattern is drawn, like a face. 'What is
that?' I asked them. That? oh, that's G'il,' they
answered in an off-hand careless way, without any
of the reverence they would have used if they had
thought G'il a god. But nevertheless I noted
that everywhere, throughout that whole island,
submissive remarks about G'il, were far more numerous
than those about Bashwa. That made me
begin collecting those references; and presently I
found that most things of which that tribe approved
were spoken of as being g'il, or very g'il,
and things they didn't like were damned as na-g'il.</p>

<p>"It was a little difficult to understand their
exact conception of G'il, but apparently it typified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the hut, or the hut point of view. Marriage was
g'il, and good manners and building materials,
because they all made for hut-life. Inhospitality
was na-g'il, and the infidelity of women, and
earthquakes, and leaks.</p>

<p>"They sometimes personified G'il and talked of
him as he. 'G'il loves not Wheesha' (the wind);
'G'il comforts the weary'; 'G'il says, "Get more
children."' But all this was only in their fanciful
moments. At other times G'il was merely the
mat that they slept on. When I said to them,
'G'il is your real God,' they laughed at my stupidity&mdash;good
humoredly, as though there were
something, perhaps, in my idea, yet with a complacent
assurance that I was preposterous. I did
not argue with them. One couldn't, you know.
I simply continued my observations, corroborating
my theory at every turn. To give you an
instance: Bashwa is supposed to think highly of
hunters and sailors, and the Waam-folk always
profess to think highly of them too. That attitude,
however, is only official, not real. Very
few of them actually become sailors. The life
is na-g'il."</p>

<p>He came to a pause.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether we, too, have a G'il," I
said, to humor him. "We shall have to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
some of your Waam-folk to come here and tell
us."</p>

<p>The explorer looked me over as though he
were "continuing his observations" of <i>my</i> manners
and customs. "Yes," he said, "there's a
white man's G'il."</p>

<p>I regretted having mentioned it.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess what he is?" he inquired.
"I say 'he' because, like the Waam G'il, he is
sometimes personified. Come now! Apply the
test. He doesn't typify the Waam Islander point
of view: he isn't a mat. But examine your huts
and your conversation, and you'll easily spot him.
No, I'm not talking of money, or power, or success:
you may bow down to these,&mdash;but not blindly.
You at least know what you are doing. The worship
of a G'il is unconscious, and hence more insidious.
Even when an explorer points it out, you
won't see its importance. It will seem insignificant
to you. And yet, while the Bashwa to
whom you build temples is only occasionally deferred
to, this G'il of yours sways you in all things.
He is the first whom you think of when you rise,
and the last when you go to bed. You speak of
your G'il hourly or oftener, all day long. Those
of you who heed him too little are disapproved of
by everybody, while the American who succeeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in life is the man who is most careful of G'il.</p>

<p>"I have habits," he morosely continued, "of doing
certain things,&mdash;eating my meals for instance,&mdash;at
quite different hours from those that are
prevalent here. I find that every one who hears
of this is surprised at my ways. Their attitude,
while not openly intolerant, is distinctly disapproving.
When I ask them why, I get no answer&mdash;no
rational answer. They say simply, 'It's the wrong
time.' Following up this clue I have noticed that
not only is the time for performing an act supposed
to be sometimes 'wrong' and sometimes
'right,' but that the idea of time governs all
of you, like an absolute tyrant. Even your so-called
free-thinkers, who lead a life without God,
never dream of daring to live without a clock and
a calendar. And just as the Waam-folk are unconsciously
obsessed by their hut-thought, and see
everything from that angle, so you have drifted
into an exaggerated pre-occupation with time. No
matter what you may want to do, you first look at
the clock, to see if it is the right time for doing it:
if it isn't, you wait. You feel that you 'ought' to....
And each caste among you has its own hours.
A difference of thirty minutes in the hour at which
a family has dinner, marks a difference in their
social scale. 'There isn't time,' you sigh, submissively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
when you give up something you'd like
to do. 'Time is money,' is one of your phrases.
'Give me time,' is your prayer. Your big books
of maxims are full of the respect you feel toward
him. 'The greatest crime is loss of time.' 'Time
flies.' 'Time waits for no man.' These are
only small instances, but their total effect is not
small, for it is life itself that you sacrifice to this
fetish. Your G'il actually won't let you take
good full draughts of existence&mdash;he keeps you so
busy dividing it into months, days, and minutes.
You imagine that it is because you lead crowded
lives that you do it. But it is because you're
always thinking of time that you lead crowded
lives.</p>

<p>"You are smiling at me good humoredly, my
friend. I see that, like the Waam Islanders, you
think I am preposterous. It is the old story.
You cannot view yourself from without. You
will admit that considerations of time enter into
all your acts, and yet&mdash;this seems trivial? And it
is inconceivable to you that you are its slaves?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I interposed, "a strict observance
of the laws of time enables a man to live a
much fuller life."</p>

<p>"It is what all devotees say of all gods," he
murmured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are not its slaves," I continued. "That's
absurd. We have only a sensible regard for it,
as every one must."</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" he cried. "But you do not say 'one
must' when your Bashwa speaks.</p>

<p>"Your Bashwa thinks highly of those who do
good works without ceasing. You profess to
think highly of them too; that is your official attitude.
In reality, how very few of you lead that
life. It happens to be na-g'il, you see. You
haven't the time.</p>

<p>"Look about you if you would convince yourself.
The concrete evidence alone is enough.
On the breasts or the wrists of your women, and
in every man's pocket you see a G'il amulet, a
watch, to remind them of time every hour. What
other god was ever so faithfully worshipped? In
every hut in the land you will find his altar, and in
your large huts you will find one in every principal
room. No matter how free and unconventional
their owners may be, no matter how those
rooms may vary in their arrangement or furnishings,
there stands always in the most prominent
place the thing called the mantel; on it, ceremonially
flanked by two candlesticks, or vases, sits G'il,
the timepiece; and his is the face of all others you
most frequently consult. Blind and idolatrous
tribesman! time is your deity!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, that's all there was to our interview, for
at this point he came to a pause and I rose to
leave, explaining to him, soothingly (though I
must confess it had a strangely opposite effect)
that I had to go because it was getting so late.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Annual Report of the League for
Improving the Lives of the Rich</h2>


<p>To begin with, there is one objection that is
constantly made to the work of this League.
Our critics do not understand why we do so
much for the rich. They grant that many rich
people are unhappy and lead miserable lives; but
they argue that if they suffer from riches, it must
be their own fault. Nobody would have to stay
rich, they say, if he would just make an effort:
and if he has too much money and yet won't give
it away, he must be a bad lot.</p>

<p>We believe these assertions are mistaken in
every particular. The rich are not really a bad
lot. We must not judge by appearances. If it
weren't for their money they would be indistinguishable
from the rest of us. But money brings
out their weaknesses, naturally. Would it not
bring out ours? A moderate addiction to money
may not always be hurtful; but when taken in excess
it is nearly always bad for the health, it limits
one's chance of indulging in nice simple pleasures,
and in many cases it lowers the whole moral tone.
The rich admit this&mdash;of each other; but what can
they do? Once a man has begun to accumulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
money, it is unnatural to stop. He actually gets
in a state where he wants more and more.</p>

<p>This may seem incomprehensible to those who
have never suffered from affluence, and yet they
would feel the same way, in a millionaire's place.
A man begins by thinking that <i>he</i> can have money
without being its victim. He will admit that other
men addicted to wealth find it hard to be moderate,
but he always is convinced that he is different
and has more self-control. But the growth of an
appetite is determined by nature, not men, and this
is as true of getting money as of anything else.
As soon as a man is used to a certain amount, no
matter how large, his ideas of what is suitable expand.
That is the way men are made.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mere having of money has the
effect on most men of insidiously making them
more and more dependent on having it. Of course
a man will hate to believe that this is true of himself,
but sooner or later money affects him as
drugs do a dope-fiend. It is not really much joy
to him, but it scares him to think of giving it up.
When you urge a rich man to pull himself together,
to summon his manhood and try, only
<i>try</i>, for a while to depend on himself, he tells you
he'd like to, perhaps, but he hasn't the strength.
He can't take life that way. He can't face the
world even a month without money in the bank.</p>

<p>Even so, why should the rest of us feel it's our
duty to help? Why not wait until the rich come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to ask our advice, if they're troubled? Ah, but
they wouldn't. They couldn't. The rich have
their pride. Their unfortunate weakness for
money may blacken their lives, but they suffer
in silence. They try to conceal it all from us.
Their feverish attempts to find some sunshine in
life every evening, the desperate and futile migrations
they make each few months, and the pathetic
mental deadness of their gatherings, they try to
keep private. We might never know to what
straits many rich folk have come, were it not for
the newspapers and their kindly society columns.
Bless their noble insistence on showing us the lives
of the rich, their portraying with such faithful
care each detail of their ways!</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to reform these rich people
offhand. Just to call at their houses and advise
them, when you aren't too busy&mdash;that would be a
kindness, of course, but quite far from a cure.
Besides, they might even resent your little calls as
intrusions. A good-hearted reformer would certainly
endanger his comfort, and he might risk
his life, trying to get in past rich people's butlers.
Don't go in those districts at all, that is this
League's advice. The drinking, bad language,
the quarrels and shooting affrays, armed watchmen,
fast motors&mdash;all these make those streets
quite unsuited for decent folks' use.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we do? We can't just walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
selfishly off and go mind our own business. The
rich are our brothers. How can the rest of us let
ourselves be truly happy when our brothers are
suffering?</p>

<p>That's where this League steps forward. This
League will provide ways in which any reformer
can help.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>(1) It plans to establish neighborhood
houses in all the rich centers, where those who
can stand it can go and live just like the rich.
It will thus enable a few of us to mingle with
them, day by day, and gradually brighten their
outlook and better their standards.</p>

<p>(2) It will send trained welfare workers
to inspect the most desperate cases and gently
reform one by one their conditions of living.</p>

<p>(3) It will instruct volunteers in the best
methods of rich relief work, especially methods
of relieving the rich of their wealth.</p></div>

<p>The most common type we treat is the man who
is making great efforts to keep other people from
getting his money away from him. Such a man is
always in a nervous, excitable state. In fact our
statistics show that many died from this strain.
The typical case gets a temperature daily, from
what he sees in the papers, about the attacks
which radical persons are constantly making on
property. Inflammation sets in, and his outbursts
grow more noisy and violent. He practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
racks himself to pieces. It is a most painful end.</p>

<p>Other men try to invest money securely. This
is a strain too. It leads to constant worries and
losses, no matter what they invest in. Again,
every man of means is exposed to innumerable
skillful appeals to devote all he has to some new
educational uses, or to lend it to friends in great
need, or give aid to the sick. These appeals are
so pressing that it wears out a man's strength to
refuse them; and yet, since they are endless, he
must. He can't give to them all. He must practice
ways of dodging the determined askers who
hunt him and trail him. Rich women, alone with
their mail on a bright sunny morning, must learn
to throw even the most pathetic circulars in the
waste-paper-basket. In other words they must
harden their hearts. But that hardens their arteries.
It also gives them a disagreeable disposition;
and that's quite a load.</p>

<p>It means much to the rich when our League
takes these weights off their minds.</p>

<p>But the best way to give an idea of the good
we are doing, will be to cite just a few special
cases we have helped in the past:</p>


<h5>CASE 102</h5>

<p>Case 102 was a wealthy and ignorant girl who
was found one cold morning exhibiting toy dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
at a show. The dogs had been fed heartily, but
the poor girl had had nothing to eat but raw carrots,
which she had been told she must live on, to
help her complexion. She had a hardened disposition,
dull outlook, and deficient physique.
Her home was like a furniture warehouse, especially
her bedroom, a huge, over-decorated chamber,
where she slept all alone. After a friendly
study had been made of her case, her money was
quietly taken away by degrees, this being accomplished
with the aid of an old family lawyer, who
was genuinely interested in helping his clients all
he could in this way; and when this girl had
thus reached a healthfully destitute state, a husband
was found for her in the janitor of a Hoboken flat.
This man is often kind to her when she
does well in her work. She is not yet happy,
but she is interested intensely in life. When
we last saw this case, she was occupying a dark
but cozy sub-basement, where she was sleeping
three in a bed and had six children, though
only four are now living with her, the others having
run off; and her days were filled to the brim
with wholesome toil.</p>


<h5>CASE 176</h5>

<p>Case 176 was an elderly clubman who had for
many years terrorized his small family, his outbreaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
being attributed by him to the coffee. He
said and believed that if his coffee were carefully
made, he would be content. Investigation showed
that it wasn't this but his money which was the
root of the trouble. By nature a fighter, what he
needed was plenty of personal conflicts, but his
money had led to his living a sheltered life which
gave him no scope. He had so much wealth that
it took two nerve specialists over six months, in
fact it took them nearly a year, before the amount
of their bills had eaten up all his property.
When this was done, however, employment was
secured for the old gentleman on the police force,
where his peculiar gift of ferocity could find more
room for use. The coffee in the station-house,
fortunately, was execrable, and this stirred him
to a pitch which soon made him the ablest patrolman
in his ward. He was then sent to clean up
the three toughest districts in town, which he did
with the utmost rigor in less than four days, completely
overawing, single-handed, their turbulent
gangs. At the police parade, recently, he was
given a medal, the gift of a citizens' committee
which admired his work. At the head of this
committee, it may be added, was his former pastor,
who had often reproached him in the old days
for his profanity and violence. It is these very
qualities that are now enabling him to do such
good work, and thus winning him a warm place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in the community's heart. Meantime a letter of
gratitude has been received by the League from
his family, who have been removed to a quiet industrial
farm in Connecticut, and whose thankfulness
is touching for the peace that has come
into their lives.</p>


<h5>CASE 190</h5>

<p>Case 190 was a baffling one in some ways. It
was that of a dyspeptic society woman who spent
her evenings at functions. She suffered greatly
from colds, yet felt obliged to wear large, chilly
collars of diamonds, and to sit in an open opera
box unprotected from drafts. Although fretful
and unhappy, she nevertheless objected most
strongly to trying a life without money; so our
district visitors had to devise other methods.</p>

<p>They began by removing several disease-breeding
pets from the home. They then had the
French chef deported, and taught the woman to
live on a few simple dishes. These alleviatory
arrangements resulted in some slight improvement.
Like all half-way measures, however, they
left her cure incomplete.</p>

<p>Then, almost by accident, a dealer in investment
securities lost most of her fortune. The
balance was taken by some cheery university presidents,
who made her build infirmaries for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in spite of rebuffs. Soon after she thus had been
thrown on her own resources at last, a place was
found for her to do ironing in a nice warm steam
laundry, one of the high-grade ones where all the
corrosives are put in by hand. The light exercise
this work gives her has cured her dyspepsia. She
now gets through at nine-thirty evenings, instead
of sitting up till past midnight; and as she can
wear a red-flannel undersuit, she has no more
colds.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Other cases must be summarized instead of presented
in detail. Anæmic young belles who used
to be kept in ill-ventilated rooms every night, are
sent for and taken to those open piers on the river,
where they can dance with strong, manly grocers,
or aldermen even, and where the river breezes
soon bring back a glow to their cheeks. Gentlemen
suffering from obesity have been carried to
an old-fashioned woodyard to work, or, if entirely
unskilled, they are given jobs helping
plumbers. Hundreds of desperate children have
been rescued from nurse girls, who were punishing
them for romping and shouting, and shackling
them in starched clothing. These children we try
to turn loose on the lively East Side, where they
can join in the vigorous games of the slums.
Most rewarding of all, perhaps, are the young
men of means who have been saved from lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
indescribable folly, and who, through the simple
abolition of inherited wealth, have been made
into self-supporting, responsible citizens.</p>

<p>I cannot say more of the League's work in this
brief report. But I must end by admitting that
though we have done all we could, the hidden distress
that still exists in rich homes is widespread.
Families continue to engage in poisonous quarrels,
idleness and chronic unemployment remain unabated,
and discontent is gradually darkening the
minds of its victims, depriving them of true mental
vigor and even of sleep.</p>

<p>On the good side we have the fact that the nation
appears to be roused. It is not roused very
much, but it takes more interest than it once did,
at least. To leave the rich to wrestle with their
fortunes, alone and unaided, as was done in our
grandfathers' times, seems unnatural in ours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, frankly, there is as yet no
cure in sight. The difficulty is to devise legislation
which will absorb excess wealth. At first
sight this seems easy, and many new laws have
been passed which the rich themselves have predicted
would immediately reduce them to indigence.
But somehow no law has yet done this.
So we must just struggle on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h2>From Noah to Now</h2>


<p>
In the days of Father Noah life was sweet&mdash;life was sweet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He played the soft majubal every day.</span><br />
And for centuries and centuries he never crossed the street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much less supposed he'd ever move away.</span><br />
But times grew bad and men grew bad, all up and down the land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the soft majubal got all out of key;</span><br />
And when the weather changed, besides, 'twas more than he could stand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So Father Noah he packed and put to sea.</span><br />
<br />
And "Yo-ho-ho," with a mournful howl, said the poor old boy to Ham;<br />
And "Yo-ho-ho," sang Japhet, and a pink but tuneful clam;<br />
And "Yo-ho-ho," cried the sheep, and Shem, and a pair of protozoa:<br />
"We're a-going to roam till we find a home that will suit old Father Noah."<br />
</p>

<p>There used to be rumors of a country that men
called Atlantis. It was said to lie far out at sea.
A magnificent country. The people there were
happier and freer than anywhere else. It was
also a land where it was no trouble at all to be
rich, and where strangers were treated as equals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and welcomed as friends. Until it disappeared
so mysteriously it was like an America, a land to
which the people of those ancient times longed to
go.</p>

<p>I dreamed once that it had not disappeared,
after all, but that it was still to be found if you
took a long voyage, and that it was happier and
freer and finer than ever. And I wanted to go
there. I dreamed that America had got itself
in such trouble that thousands of people were
leaving to live in Atlantis. This part of my
dream was a nightmare, and not at all clear, but
my recollection is that we'd elected Amy Lowell as
President. And she said her understanding was
that she'd been elected for life; and when any
one disagreed with her, she sent a porter around
to cut off his head. And decade after decade
passed by, and she danced with the Senate, and
made us sing to her at sunrise on the steps of the
White House. And she wrote all the hymns. So
we wanted to move to Atlantis.</p>

<p>But it wasn't at all easy to emigrate and give
up America. In spite of the way that Amy beheaded
us, we were fond of our country. And
we knew if we went to another we mightn't come
back. You can imagine how it would feel, perhaps,
if you yourself were leaving America, and
looking for the last time at all the little things in
your room, and walking for the last time in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
streets or the fields you knew best. And the day
before sailing you would go around seeing your
friends, and saying good-by to them, knowing you
wouldn't see them again. And then on the last
day you'd sit for a while with your mother, and she
would talk of your plans and your comforts, and
you'd both be quite calm. And the hour to go
would come; and you'd kiss her. And she'd suddenly
cling to you....</p>

<span class="caption">A porter was sent around to cut off his head</span>
</div>

<p>Then the ship, and the steam-whistles calling,
and the gray, endless sea. And you up on deck,
day by day, staring out at the waters; and seeing
not them but your loved ones, or bits of your
home: wondering if you'd been courageous to
leave it, or cold, and a fool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>But the sunsets and dawns, and the winds&mdash;strong
and clean&mdash;would bring peace. You would
think of the new world you were sailing to, and of
how good it would be there, and of how you would
prosper, and the long, happy life you would lead....
And the voyage would come to an end, and
you'd sail up the harbor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_140.png" width="500" height="397" alt="ATLANTIS BANK &quot;Okkabab! See them clothes!&quot;" title="ATLANTIS BANK &quot;Okkabab! See them clothes!&quot;" />
<span class="caption">ATLANTIS BANK &quot;Okkabab! See them clothes!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then at the dock, men in strange clothing would
shout orders at you; "Peely wush, okka Hoogs!
Peely wush! Okkabab!" and you would discover
that peely wush meant hurry up, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
okka was a swear word and that when they said
Hoog they meant you. It would be a comic nickname,
you know: as we say Chinks for Chinamen.
And they'd hustle you Hoogs off the ship, and
shove you around on the pier, and examine your
eyes and your pocket-books, and at last set you
free.</p>

<p>And there you would be, in Atlantis, where
people were happy.</p>

<p>But you'd find at the start that Atlantis was
busy and rough; and parts of the city would be
dirty and have a bad smell. And then you would
find that the Hoogs mostly lived in those parts,
and had to work at pretty nearly anything to pay
for their lodging. You'd see Americans that you
knew; Senator Smoot, perhaps, sewing shirts; and
the Rev. Samuel Drury would be standing in the
street peddling shoestrings. The reason for this
would be that until they knew what okkabab
meant, and could read and write the language of
Atlantis, and spell its odd spellings, and pronounce
it without too much of an American accent, they
couldn't get any but unskilled and underpaid jobs.
Meantime they would look to a native like cheap,
outlandish peddlers. Even their own fellow-immigrants
would try to exploit them. And instead
of their finding it easy to get rich, as they'd
hoped, they would be so hard up that they'd have
to fight like wolves for each nickel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Your American clothes would be another difficulty,
because they'd be laughed at. You'd have
to buy and learn to wear the kind of things they
wore in Atlantis. And your most polite ways
would seem rude in Atlantis, or silly; so you'd
have to learn <i>their</i> rules of politeness, which would
strike <i>you</i> as silly. And you'd have to learn
habits of living which would often amaze you;
and if you were slow to adopt them, they'd class
you as queer. Their ideas of joking would also
be different from yours; and you'd slowly and
awkwardly discover what was fun in Atlantis.</p>

<p>You'd have to change yourself in so many ways,
your old friends wouldn't know you. Pretty soon
you wouldn't be an American at all any longer.
And yet you would never feel wholly an Atlantisan
either. Your children would look down on you
as a greenhorn, and laugh at your slips. They
would seem unsympathetic, or different,&mdash;not
quite your own children.</p>

<p>The natives of Atlantis would help you along,
once in a while, by giving you lectures and telling
you not to read your home paper. But you, who
had felt so adventurous and bold, when you started,
would have to get used to their regarding you
as a comic inferior. Not even your children
would know what you had had to contend with.
Not one of the natives would try to put himself
in your place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet how could they? How could any one who
hadn't gone through the experience? It is a complicated
matter to learn to belong to a strange
country, when the process includes making yourself
over to fit other men's notions.</p>

<p>It was easy for Noah: all he had to get used to
was Ararat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h2>Sic Semper Dissenters</h2>


<p>Written during the war-time censorship of our late
Postmaster-General.</p>


<p>
In the town of Hottentottenville an aged Hottentot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose name was Hottentotten-tillypoo,</span><br />
Was slowly hottentottering around a vacant lot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a vacant look upon his higaboo.</span><br />
Now higaboo is Hottentot, as you may know, for face,<br />
And to wear a vacant look upon your face is a disgrace.<br />
But poor old Mr. Tillypoo, he had no other place&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though I understand it grieved him through and thru.</span><br />
<br />
He was grubbing up potatoes in an aimless sort of way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which really was the only way he had,</span><br />
And an officer was watching him to see what he would say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And arrest him if the things he said were bad.</span><br />
For it seems this wretched Tillypoo had gone and had the thought<br />
That his neighbors didn't always do exactly as they ought;<br />
And as this was rank sedition, why, they hoped to see him caught,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it naturally made them pretty mad.</span><br />
<br />
So the men of Hottentottenville, they passed a little law,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they called the Hotta-Shotta-Shootum Act,</span><br />
Which fixed it so the postman was a sort of Grand Bashaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who determined what was false and what was fact.</span><br />
And the postman sentenced Tillypoo, and wouldn't hear his wails,<br />
But gave him twenty years apiece in all the local jails,<br />
And said he couldn't vote no more, and barred him from the mails,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And expressed the hope that this would teach him tact.</span><br />
<br />
Well, the last I heard of Tilly he was planning not to think,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he'd tied a piece of string around his tongue,</span><br />
And he never went within a mile of either pen or ink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he always stood when <i>any</i> song was sung.</span><br />
And maybe you are thinking that his fate was rather tough,<br />
But what I say is, not a bit, they didn't do enough.<br />
When anybody differs with you, dammit, treat 'em rough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, they ought to be bub-boiled alive and hung!</span><br />

<h2>Humpty-Dumpty and Adam</h2>


<p>It is not only every country that has its own
language. It is each generation. The books
and family letters of our grandfathers are not
quite in our dialect. And so of the books of their
grandfathers, and the letters they wrote. These
dialects are not so different from ours that we
can't make them out: they sound a little queer,
that is all. Just as our own way of talking and
writing (and thinking) will seem so quaint to
our descendants that they'll put us away on the
shelves.</p>

<p>A few books are written in a tongue that all
times understand.</p>

<p>A few of us are linguists and have learned to
enjoy the books of all ages.</p>

<p>For the rest, agèd books need translation into
the speech of the day.</p>

<p>The poets of each generation seldom sing a new
song. They turn to themes men always have
loved, and sing them in the mode of their times.
Each new tribe of artists perpetually repaints the
same pictures. The story-men tell the same
stories. They remain fresh and young.</p>

<p>The disguise is new sometimes, but never the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
story behind it. A few generations ago, when
some one wrote Humpty-Dumpty, he was merely
retelling an old story for the men of his era, one
of the oldest of stories, the first part of Genesis.</p>

<p>It is a condensed account&mdash;it leaves out the serpent
and Eve and the apple. Some editor blue-penciled
these parts, perhaps, as fanciful little digressions.
"Stick to the main theme," said the
editor, "don't go wandering off into frills. Your
story is about the fall of Adam. Get on. Make
him fall."</p>

<p>"I had intended to introduce a love-interest,"
the author of Humpty-Dumpty explained.</p>

<p>"A love interest!" sneered the editor. "You
should have waited to be born in the twentieth
century. These are manlier times. Give us men
and adventure and fate."</p>

<p>"And what about the garden," the author
sighed. "Must that be cut too?"</p>

<p>"By all means. Change the garden. It's a
pretty enough idea in romance. But a realist who
has worked in one, knows that a garden's no paradise.
Genesis got it just wrong. Adam should
have been exiled from town as a punishment, and
put to slave in a garden."</p>

<p>"But town isn't paradise either. We've got to
start him in paradise."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the editor. "There's only
one place left to put the fellow, and that's on the
wall. 'Adam sat on a wall.' Begin that way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_148.png" width="500" height="289" alt="Cinderella" title="Cinderella" />
<span class="caption">Cinderella</span>
</div>

<p>"I'm calling him Humpty-Dumpty," the author
said. "It makes it less tragic. It suggests that
the fall didn't hurt Man so much after all."</p>

<p>"Which is true," said the editor.</p>

<p>I wish I had known that author. He had a
kind heart. He has changed even the unforgiving
cherubim in the Genesis story to those King's
men who try in such a friendly way to restore
Humpty-Dumpty. But the story can't let them.
That would leave the hero back on his wall
again&mdash;like some Greek philosopher. This other
way, we think of him as starting out to conquer the
world.</p>

<p>Humpty-Dumpty is a story for boys. Cinderella
for girls. In Cinderella five able females,
two old and three young, contend most resourcefully
to capture one stupid young man. It is a
terrible story. The beautiful surface barely masks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the hungry wiles underneath. But it's true. It
depicts the exact situation a marrying girl has
to face; and, even while she's a tot in the nursery,
it reminds her to plan.</p>

<p>But these are examples of stories that live,
and last for more than one age. The mortality
is heavier in other fields. For instance, philosophy.
Great philosophical works of past eras
are still alive in a sense, but they dwell among us
as foreigners do, while Mother Goose has been
naturalized.</p>

<p>Modern philosophies are so different. Not
many centuries ago, in those eras when few
changes took place, men thought of the world
as something to study, instead of to mold. It
was something to appropriate and possess, to be
sure, but not to transform.</p>

<p>Humpty-Dumpty sat on the wall, then. He
hadn't begun his new life.</p>

<p>There were few inventors in those old times,
and few of those few were honored. Edison
among the Greeks would have been as lonely
as Plato with us.</p>

<p>Civilization was Thought. It was measured
by what men knew and felt of eternal things.
It was wisdom.</p>

<p>Civilization to-day is invention: it is measured
by our control over nature. If you remind a
modern that nature is not wholly ductile, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
profoundly discouraged! "We <i>expect</i> to make
over and control our world." We not only
assume it is possible, we assume it is best.</p>

<p>What is democracy but a form of this impulse,
says Professor George Plimpton Adams,
"bidding man not to content himself with any
political order thrust upon him, but actively
to construct that order so that it does respond
to his own nature"?</p>

<p>"Not contemplation ... but creative activity,"
that is our modern attitude.</p>

<p>Well, it's all very interesting.</p>

<p>Will and Wisdom are both mighty leaders.
Our times worship Will.</p>

<h2>How It Looks to a Fish</h2>


<p>The most ordinary steamship agent, talking to
peasants in Europe, can describe America in such
a way that those peasants will start there at
once. But the most gifted preacher can't get
men to hurry to heaven.</p>

<p>All sorts of prophets have dreamed of a heaven,
and they have imagined all kinds; they have put
houris in the Mahometan's paradise, and swords
in Valhalla. But in spite of having carte blanche
they have never invented a good one.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/ill_151.png" width="200" height="362" alt="&quot;I&#39;ve stood corns and neuritis&mdash;&quot;" title="&quot;I&#39;ve stood corns and neuritis&mdash;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I&#39;ve stood corns and neuritis&mdash;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A man sits in his pew, hearing about harps and
halos and hymns, and when it's
all over he goes home and
puts on his old wrapper. "I
suppose I can stand it," he
thinks. "I've stood corns and
neuritis. But I just hate the
idea of floating around any
such region."</p>

<p>Some persons may want to
go to heaven so as to keep out
of hell, or to get away from
misery here&mdash;if they are in
great enough misery. Others
think of it as a place to meet friends in, or as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
suitable destination for relatives. But the general
idea is it's like being cast away in the tropics:
the surroundings are
gorgeous, and it's
pleasant and warm&mdash;but
not home.</p>

<p>It seems too bad
that heaven should always
be somehow repugnant,
and unfit as
it were for human
habitation. Isn't there
something we can do
about it?</p>

<p>I fear there is not.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/ill_152.png" width="225" height="326" alt="&quot;But I just hate the idea of floating&quot;" title="&quot;But I just hate the idea of floating&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;But I just hate the idea of floating&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Assuming that we
are immortal, what happens to a man when he
dies? It is said by some that at first the surroundings
in his new life seem shadowy, but after
a bit they grow solid; and then it is the world left
behind that seems vague. You lose touch with
it and with those whom you knew there&mdash;except
when they think of you. When they think of you,
although you can see them, and feel what they're
thinking, it isn't like hearing the words that they
say, or their voices; it's not like looking over their
shoulders to see what they write; it's more like
sensing what is in their thoughts.</p>

<p>But at first you are too bewildered to do this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
You are in a new world, and you find yourself surrounded
by spirits, telling you that you're dead.
The spiritualists say that many new arrivals refuse
to believe they are dead, and look around
skeptically at heaven, and think they are dreaming.
It often takes a long time to convince them. This
must be rather awkward. It's as though no one
who arrived in Chicago would believe he was
there, but went stumbling around, treating citizens
as though they weren't real, and saying that
he doubted whether there was any such place as
Chicago.</p>

<p>But if there is any truth in this picture, it
explains a great deal. If the spirits themselves
cannot clearly take in their new life at first,
how can we on this side of the barrier ever understand
what it's like? And, not understanding,
what wonder we don't find it attractive?</p>

<p>You can't describe one kind of existence to those
in another.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, we were describing dry
land to a fish.</p>

<p>"We have steam-heat and sun-sets," I might
tell him&mdash;just for a beginning.</p>

<p>And the fish would think: "Heat? Phew!
that's murderous! And oh, that sizzling old
sun!"</p>

<p>"We have legs," I might add.</p>

<p>"What are legs?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Things to walk on. They're like sticks, that
grow right on our bodies. We do not use fins."</p>

<p>"What, no fins! Why, with fins, just a flicker
will shoot me in any direction. Legs are clumsy
and slow: think of tottering around on such
stumps! And you can only go on the level with
them; you can't rise and dip."</p>

<p>"Yes, we can. We build stairs."</p>

<p>"But how primitive!"</p>

<p>Perhaps he would ask me what drawbacks there
were to earthly existence; and how he would
moan when I told him about bills and battles.</p>

<p>"And is it true," he might say, "that there
really are beings called dentists? Weird creatures,
who pull your poor teeth out, and hammer
your mouths? Bless my gills! It sounds dreadful!
Don't ask me to leave my nice ocean!"</p>

<p>Then, to be fair, he might ask, "What's the
other side of the picture, old man? What pleasures
have you that would tempt me? What do
you do to amuse yourselves?" And I would tell
him about Charlie Chaplin, and Geraldine Farrar,
and business, and poetry&mdash;but how could I describe
Charlie Chaplin from the fish point of view?
And poetry?&mdash;getting ecstasy from little black
dots on a page? "You get soulful over <i>that</i> kind
of doings?" he would ask, with a smile. "Well,
all right, but it sounds pretty crazy to a sensible
fish."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Business is the main thing here, anyhow," I'd
answer.</p>

<p>"And what's 'business'?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's&mdash;er&mdash;it's like this: Suppose you, for
instance, were to go and catch
a great many flies&mdash;"</p>

<span class="caption">He smiled dreamily</span>
</div>

<p>The fish would look pleased
and smile dreamily.</p>

<p>"But then not eat them, mind
you."</p>

<p>"Not <i>eat</i> them?"</p>

<p>"No, but put them all out on
a bit of flat rock, for a counter,
and 'sell' them to other fish: exchange them, I
mean&mdash;for shells, let us say, if you used shells as
money."</p>

<p>The fish would
look puzzled. "But
what <i>for</i>, my dear
sir?" he'd inquire.
"What would I do
with shells?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

see?"</p>

<h2>A Hopeful Old Bigamist</h2>


<p>There are any number of difficulties and bumps
along the roads of this world, and yet there are
plenty of easy-going people who never prepare for
them. They take all such things as they come.
Some are buoyant, some fearless.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_156.png" width="500" height="279" alt="You may die any minute!" title="You may die any minute!" />
<span class="caption">You may die any minute!</span>
</div>

<p>But within the last hundred years, large companies
have been organized to go after these
people, and catch them alone somewhere and give
them a good thorough fright. These companies
hire men who are experts at that sort of thing;
men who make it their life-work to find fearless
persons and scare them.</p>

<p>But no matter how ambitious and active these
experts may be, they cannot catch every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
personally. It would take too much time. So
they write gloomy advertisements which are designed
to scare people in general.</p>

<p>These advertisements are a characteristic feature
of our civilization.</p>

<p>Man goes down-town, whistling, sunny morning.
Happens to pick up a magazine. Immediately
he gets hit in the eye with a harrowing
picture. Sometimes it is one that reminds him
he may die any minute, and depicts his widow and
children limping around in the streets, hunting
crusts. Or it may be a picture of his house burning
up, or his motor upsetting. Or an illness, and
there he is lying flat and weak on his bed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_157.png" width="500" height="305" alt="Ah!&mdash;Her husband didn&#39;t insure" title="Ah&mdash;Her husband didn&#39;t insure" />
<span class="caption">Ah!&mdash;Her husband didn&#39;t insure</span>
</div>

<p>After he has seen a good many of such pictures,
he grows quiet. Stops whistling. He learns how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to worry, and he worries off and on till it hurts.
Then, to get some relief, he makes a contract with
one of those companies, which provides him with
what we call insurance, for an annual tribute.</p>

<p>I hope no one will think I am disparaging insurance,
which is a useful arrangement. It enables
many of us to pool our risks and be protected
from hardship. And the best companies nowadays
handle the thing very well. They scare a
person as little as possible. They just gently depress
him. They inflict just enough mental torture
to get him to put in his money. It is only
when he is stubborn about it that they give him the
cold chills.</p>

<p>Every century has some such institution. The
Inquisition was worse.</p>

<p>Like insurance, it had high ideals, but peculiar
methods.</p>

<p>Insurance men, however, are steadily improving
their methods. Instead of always reminding you
how awful it is not to insure, they sometimes print
brighter pictures, which show how happy you will
feel if you do. For instance, a picture of a postman
bringing a check to your widow. Your widow
is thanking the postman, her face full of joy.
Sometimes the old president of the company is
shown in the upper left corner, writing out the
check personally, as soon as he hears of your
death. Or maybe they leave out the president<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and put in your infant son, for good measure. He
is playing in his innocent way with his dead father's
cane, and the widow, with a speculative eye
on him, is thoughtfully murmuring, "As soon as
he is old enough I must insure my little boy too."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the days before it was possible to insure,
there was even more gloom. Light-hearted
people may have worried less, but the rest worried
more. They could save enough money for the
future if it was sufficiently distant, but not for a
serious disaster that might come too soon. This
darkened their outlook. They had no one to trust
in but God.</p>

<p>There has always been a great deal of talk
about trusting in God, but human beings incline to
be moderate and cautious in trying it. As a rule
no one does it unless he has to.</p>

<p>Not even the clergymen.</p>

<p>A few years ago a fund was formed, in the Episcopal
Church, to pay agèd ministers pensions, so
they would never be destitute. This brought the
greatest happiness to many of them who were approaching
decrepitude. Letters came in from
ministers who had worried in silence for years,
with no one to trust but the Deity, whose plans
might be strange. They described how they had
wept with relief, when this fund was established.
Printed copies of these letters were mailed to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the good Christians who had contributed, to show
them how much true joy and happiness their
money had brought, and how thankful the clergy
were to have something solid to trust, like a pension.</p>

<p>When a pastor with a pension is in the pulpit,
looking around at his flock, suppose he sees that
some of them are needy and have no pensions
coming? If imaginative enough, he will sympathize
with their poor fearful hearts, and advise
them as wisely as possible. But there's not much
to say. The only course for such folk is to try to
trust God, who is mighty, and meantime be frugal
and save every cent that they can.</p>

<p>Some day, he prays, we all shall have pensions.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And suppose a man isn't religious, what had he
better trust? His money, or his own native mettle?</p>

<p>I should like to trust both.</p>

<p>But they tell me that that is impracticable.
Won't work at all. I can <i>have</i> some of both, of
course. Certainly. But I cannot <i>trust</i> both.</p>

<p>Like all other men I have my own inner fountain
of strength, and it's been a faithful old thing;
it has done a lot for me. It has vigor in it yet&mdash;but
it isn't big and fiery, or strong. I could only
have made it work abundantly if I had relied
wholly on it. If I had done that, it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
probably called out my full powers. But instead
I have relied partly on money, for fear my
strength might desert me; and that fear has naturally
had an effect on my strength. I work hard,
but with less fire. Less eagerness. Progressively
less. Any man who doesn't trust his spirit
will find it will ebb.</p>

<p>And the same's true of money. Unless you
are in love with your wealth, it will slip through
your fingers. If you want to get a whole lot of
money, worship gold all your days.</p>

<p>This isn't a sure recipe, I must add, to get a
whole lot of money. I should be sorry to have
my readers spring out of their chairs at these
words, and rush happily off to make money their
god, so as to be millionaires. It doesn't work so
quickly or surely as that, I admit. But this much
is true, anyhow: if you do not care enough about
money you will hardly grow rich. You must be
pretty devoted to win a jealous mistress like gold.</p>

<p>They are both jealous mistresses, that's the
worst of it.</p>

<p>It is an awkward predicament.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I don't like to face this problem squarely. I
don't get it settled. I keep on, like a hopeful
old bigamist, in love with both mistresses: my
money and my spirit or mettle.</p>

<p>I try to soothe each. I say to my mettle, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
care much more for you than for money: it's true
that I keep money, too; but it's you that I love.
You and I are one, aren't we? Very well, then.
Come on. Let's be happy."</p>

<p>And I say to my money, "Now be faithful: for
God's sake be faithful: don't slip off and desert
me and leave me alone in the world." She looks
jealously at me. "Alone?" she says; "how about
that mettle of yours, you're so fond of?" "Ah,
my dear," I say sadly, giving her an affectionate
squeeze, "my mettle is no better than she should
be. I don't like to talk of it. You are the one
that I expect to comfort me in my dark moments;
and I hope you and I will be here together long
after my mettle has gone."</p>

<p>There you have my ménage. It's been difficult.
But I cannot complain. As a bigamist I suppose
on the whole I've been fairly successful. Yet I
know I'd have more money to-day&mdash;I think a great
deal more money&mdash;if I had been more faithful
to Mammon, as they call the poor creature. And
similarly I might have led an heroic, ardent life
with my mettle, if I had ever trusted it fully.</p>

<p>That's the trouble with bigamy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>The Revolt of Capital</h2>


<p>Once upon a time all the large corporations
were controlled by labor. The whole system was
exactly the opposite of what it is now. It was
labor that elected the directors, and the officers
too. Capital had no representatives at all in the
management.</p>

<p>It was a curious period. Think of capital having
no say, even about its own rates! When a
concern like the United Great Steel Co., was in
need of more capital, the labor man who was at
the head of it, President Albert H. Hairy, went
out and hired what he wanted on the best terms
he could. Sometimes these terms seemed cruelly
low to the capitalists, but whenever one of them
grumbled he was paid off at once, and his place was
soon taken by another who wasn't so uppish.
This made for discipline and improved the service.</p>

<p>Under this régime&mdash;as under most others&mdash;there
was often mismanagement. Those in control
paid themselves too well&mdash;as those in control
sometimes do. Failures and reorganizations resulted
from this, which reduced the usual return
to the workers and made them feel gloomy; but
as these depressions threw capitalists out of employment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and thus made capital cheaper, they had
their bright side.</p>

<p>The capitalists, however, grumbled more and
more. Even when they were well paid and well
treated they grumbled. No matter how much
they got, they felt they weren't getting their dues.
They knew that labor elected the management;
and they knew human nature. Putting these two
premises together, they drew the conclusion that
labor was probably getting more than its share,
and capital less. President Hairy, of the Steel
Co., explained to them this couldn't be true, because
the market for capital was a free and open
market. He quoted a great many economic laws
that proved it, and all the professors of economy
said he was right. But the capitalists wouldn't
believe in these laws, because they weren't on their
side, nor would they read any of the volumes the
professors composed. They would read only a
book that an old German capitalist wrote&mdash;a radical
book which turned economics all upside-down
and said that capital ought to start a class war and
govern the world.</p>

<p>Discontent breeds agitation. Agitation breeds
professional agitators. A few unruly loud-voiced
capitalists climbed up on soap-boxes and began to
harangue their quiet comrades, just to stir up needless
trouble. When arrested, they invoked (as
they put it) the right of free speech. The labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
men replied by invoking things like law and order.
Everybody became morally indignant at something.
The press invoked the Fathers of the Republic,
Magna Charta, and Justice. Excited and
bewildered by this crossfire, the police one evening
raided a Fifth avenue club, where a capitalist
named M. R. Goldman was talking in an incendiary
way to his friends. "All honest law-abiding
capitalists will applaud this raid," said the papers.
But they didn't. They began to feel persecuted.
And presently some capitalists formed what they
called a union.</p>

<p>It was only a small union, that first one, but it
had courage. One afternoon President Hairy
looked up from his desk to find four stout, red-faced
capitalists pushing each other nervously into
his office. He asked them their business. They
huskily demanded that every capitalist on that
company's books be paid at least a half per cent
more for his money. The president refused to
treat with them except as individuals. They then
called a strike.</p>

<p>The results of this first strike were profoundly
discouraging. The leaders were tried for conspiracy,
those who walked out at their call were
blacklisted, and the victorious labor men soon
secured other capitalists in plenty, a private car-load
being brought over from Philadelphia at
night. The labor leaders became so domineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in their triumph they refused to engage capitalists
who drank or who talked of their wrongs. They
began importing cheap foreign capital to supply
all new needs. But these measures of oppression
only increased the class feeling of capitalists and
taught them to stand shoulder to shoulder in the
fight for their rights.</p>

<p>The years of warfare that followed were as
obstinate as any in history. Little by little, in
spite of the labor men's sneers, the enormous
power of capital made itself felt. An army of
unemployed capitalists marched upon Washington.
The Brotherhood of Railway Bondholders,
being indicted for not buying enough new bonds
to move the mails, locked up every dollar they
possessed and defied the Government. The Industrial
Shareholders of the World, a still more
rabid body, insisted on having an eight per cent
law for their money. All great cities were the
scenes of wild capitalist riots. Formerly indifferent
citizens were alarmed and angered by seeing
their quiet streets turned into Bedlam at night,
with reckless old capitalists roaring through them
in taxis, singing Yankee Boodle or shouting
"Down with labor!" For that finally became the
cry: labor must go. They still meant to use
labor, somehow, they confusedly admitted, but
capital and not labor must have absolute control
of all industries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>As the irrepressible conflict forced its way into
politics, Congress made statesmanlike efforts to
settle the problem. After earnest and thoughtful
debate they enacted a measure which made the
first Monday in September a holiday, called Capital
Day. As this hoped-for cure did not accomplish
much they attempted another, by adding
a Secretary of Capital to the President's cabinet.
Conservative people were horrified. But Congress
was pushed even further. It was persuaded
to prohibit employing the capital of women and
children, and it ordered all Japanese capital out of
the country. On one point, however, Congress
was obstinate and would not budge an inch. They
wouldn't give capital full control of the railroads
and mills.</p>

<p>The capitalists themselves were obliged to
realize, gradually, that this could be at best but
a beautiful dream. It seemed there was one
great argument against it: labor men were a
unit in believing the scheme wouldn't work.
How could scattered investors, who had not
worked at an industry, elect&mdash;with any intelligence&mdash;the
managers of it? Even liberal labor
men said that the idea was preposterous.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At this moment a citizen of East Braintree,
Mass., stepped forward, and advocated a compromise.
He said in effect:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cause of our present industrial turmoil
is this: The rulers that govern our industries are
not rightly elected. Our boards of directors may
be called our industrial legislatures; they manage
a most important part of our national life; but
they are chosen by only one group of persons.
No others can vote. If Congress were elected by
a class, as our boards of directors are, this country
would be constantly in a state of revolution politically,
just as it is now industrially." That was
his argument.</p>

<p>"Both those who do the work and those who
put in the money should rightfully be represented
in these governing bodies." That was his cure.
If corporations would adopt this democratic
organization, he said, two-sided discussions would
take place at their meetings. "These discussions
would tend to prevent the adoption of policies
that now create endless antagonism between labor
and capital." And he went on to point out the
many other natural advantages.</p>

<p>This compromise was tried. At first it naturally
made labor angry, labor having been in
exclusive control for so long. Many laborers
declined to have anything to do with concerns
that were run by "low ignorant speculators,"
as they called them, "men who knew nothing of
any concern's real needs." Ultimately, however,
they yielded to the trend of the times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Democratic instead of autocratic control
brought about team-play. Men learned to
work together for their common good.</p>

<p>Of course capitalists and laborers did not
get on any too well together. Self-respecting
men on each side hated the other side's ways&mdash;even
their ways of dressing and talking, and
amusing themselves. The workers talked of the
dignity of labor and called capital selfish. On the
other hand, ardent young capitalists who loved
lofty ideals, complained that the dignity of capital
was not respected by labor. These young men
despised all non-capitalists on high moral grounds.
They argued that every such man who went
through life without laying aside any wealth for
those to come, must be selfish by nature and
utterly unsocial at heart. There always are
plenty of high moral grounds for both sides.</p>

<p>But this mere surface friction was hardly heard
of, except in the pages of the radical capitalist
press. There were no more strikes,&mdash;that was
the main thing. The public was happy.</p>

<p>At least, they were happy until the next problem
came along to be solved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Wild Polish Hero and the Reverend
Lyman Abbott</h2>


<p>The books a man likes best are those with
somebody in them like him. I don't say it isn't a
pleasure to read about others, but if he too is
there it's still better. And when he is the hero&mdash;ah!
It's like living a whole extra life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_174.png" width="500" height="384" alt="Ah! when I am the hero!" title="Ah! when I am the hero!" />
<span class="caption">Ah! when I am the hero!</span>
</div>

<p>But there is no drawing back, once you put
yourself into some character&mdash;you must do all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that he does, no matter how you hate his mistakes.
I remember once identifying myself with a dissolute
Pole, in a novel, who led me a dance that I
haven't forgotten yet. I ought never to have let
myself fancy that I was that fellow. He was
moody, excitable, he drank more brandy than I
was prepared to; he talked most bombastically.
He made the most pitiful jokes. But what took
my eye in him was this: he was sincere with himself.
He was only twenty-five years of age, but
though young, he was honest. When he was in
love with two women he never dodged facing it
squarely. He deceived the two women, I grant
you, but most heroes deceive themselves, too.
They tell themselves some pretty story in dilemmas
like that. This Pole always saw through
<i>his</i> stories. He questioned his heart, and listened
with reasonable honesty to its responses.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ill_175.png" width="250" height="220" alt="He deceived the two women" title="He deceived the two women" />
<span class="caption">He deceived the two women</span>
</div>

<p>Our capacity for
analyzing and criticizing
our natures
is wonderful. When
a man is without
self-awareness, I
feel toward him as
I do toward animals.</p>

<p>I admire the animals.
I am glad I am not one myself&mdash;life in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wilds must be awful&mdash;but animals are healthy and
sound; and some are good, and intelligent. Men
who can't analyze themselves may be good and
intelligent also. But they are not advanced
beings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/ill_176.png" width="375" height="453" alt="I&#39;d hate to be a wild animal" title="I&#39;d hate to be a wild animal" />
<span class="caption">I&#39;d hate to be a wild animal</span>
</div>

<p>The test of a civilized person is first self-awareness,
and then depth after depth of sincerity in
self-confrontation. "Unhealthy?" Why, certainly!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
"Risky?" Yes; like all exploring. But unless
you are capable of this kind of thinking, what are
you? No matter how able or great, you are still
with the animals.</p>

<p>Here and there is a person who achieves this in
ways of his own. Not through brain-work alone,
or most surely, can insight be won. A few have
by nature a true yet instinctive self-knowledge.
But that takes a pure soul. The tricks of self-deceiving
are too many and ingenious for most of
us....</p>

<p>Speaking of pure souls reminds me of the editor
of the Outlook, good old Lyman Abbott,
although his is unfortunately the kind that is
tastelessly pure. He's as wholesome and good as
oatmeal is, but the salt was left out. An excellent
person but wingless; not stupid, but dull. Yet&mdash;there's
something about him&mdash;he has an
attractive integrity. He puts on no airs. He is
simple, unpretentious, and he's so straightforward
he makes me respect him.</p>

<p>Many people respect Lyman Abbott. Yet I
was surprised to. Well, I had the Rollo books
given to me, as a child; I had to read them on Sundays;
and the author of those awful volumes was
Lyman Abbott's father. He wrote books for the
young. People who write books for the young
are a tribe by themselves, and little did I suppose
I should ever live to respect one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Rollo was a Sunday-school boy. Lyman Abbott's
a Sunday-school man. He combines in
himself the excellencies and the colorlessness of
the Sunday-school atmosphere. When it comes
time to group us as sheep or as goats, I know this,
there won't be any question that he is a regular
sheep. No capers for him, except the most innocent
capers. No tossing of that excellent head,
no kicking up of his heels. There isn't the faintest
suspicion of goatiness in him.</p>

<p>Yet it's strange he's so hopeless: he likes certain
forms of adventure. He was a bill-collector
once. And when Kansas was being settled so
bloodily, in our slavery days, he felt wishful to go
there. He once did some detective work too, and
he greatly enjoyed it. But his tastes are all heavily
flavored with moral intentions.</p>

<p>"My recreations," he says in his book, "I took
rather seriously. I neither danced nor played
cards, and after I joined the church very rarely
went to the theater." He liked music, liked playing
the organ. He implies that he played it however
to add to his income. He was a lawyer when
he first felt a call in his heart to the ministry.
"Had my wife objected to the change I should
have remained in the law." He has taken ale or
porter at times, "under doctor's counsel," but in
general he has been an "abstainer." ("From
both fermented and distilled liquors," he adds.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
He never has shaved, never smoked. On the
other hand, he says, "I had no inclination to be a
monk"; when not at work in the evening, "I was
likely to be out, perhaps at a concert or a religious
or political meeting, perhaps on a social call."
His father kept a boarding school for girls, and
that was where Lyman made most of his social
calls, as a youth.</p>

<p>He never overdoes anything. "It is a wise
hygienic rule to spend less strength than one can
accumulate." (That seems like the perfect recipe
for not being a genius.) A professional hypnotist
once told him he was not a good subject. "I
never have been," he writes: "I have passed
through some exciting experiences ... but I
have never been swept off my feet. I have never
lost my consciousness of self or my self-mastery.
I wonder why it is. I am not conscious of being
either especially strong-willed or especially self-possessed."</p>

<p>He reads with assiduity, he says, but without
avidity. He seems to live that way, too.</p>

<p>His sermons, his book tells us, have had merit,
but have always lacked magnetism. (You can't
sweep other people off their feet, if you can't be
swept off your own.) He likes preaching, however.
It comes easily to him.</p>

<p>We are all of us so busy with the small bits of
life we can envisage, that we don't often think of
how much we all fail to take in. Lyman Abbott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
has been kept busy being a purifying influence.
Certain other phases of life, accordingly, simply
do not exist for him. If romance tried approaching
the Reverend Lyman Abbott, at night, it
would stand no more chance than a rose would
against disinfectants.</p>

<p>Suppose that a Board of Eugenics were in
charge of this nation, what would they do with the
species this man represents? They would see his
good qualities&mdash;industry, poise, generosity. It
would be too bad to exterminate Dr. Abbott; it
is plain we need some of him. "But," they would
reflect, "this species is apt to wax numerous. We
must remember Australia and the rabbits. This
type might overrun the whole country. We might
even have to put up barbed-wire, or shoot the
excess, for us to stay human."</p>

<p>My own recommendation is to cross a few specimens
with Poles.</p>

<h2>Mrs. P's Side of It</h2>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>So Prometheus, the Titan, seeing the great need that
man had of fire, risked all and set out for Olympus, and
brought thence the flame.</i></p>

<p><i>And warmth, comfort, art and inventions spread over
the world.</i></p>

<p><i>But as to Prometheus, he was seized by the gods, in
their wrath, and chained to a rock in the Scythian wilds,
by the sea. There no ear heard his cries. There he
raged on alone, year by year, with his eyelids cut off,
while cold-hearted vultures with great beaks like horns
tore his flesh.</i></p></div>

<p>It is an interesting thing that Prometheus, who
is a hero to us, should have been regarded so differently
his contemporaries. Some thought of
him as merely a sort of social settlement-worker,
living among men to improve them, in a sleek,
earnest spirit. Some thought him a common adventurer.
Others a radical.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was really very much
like the rest of us.</p>

call him a visionary. He of course resents

not to give Mr. Prometheus that LL.D. degree.
And finally one of his friends pays him a call,
after dark, and bluntly and worriedly warns him
he's queering himself.</p>

<p>Prometheus goes upstairs, indignant, to talk to
his wife. He doesn't tell her anything about his
friend, or the community's criticisms, but he describes
all over again what a boon fire would be
to mankind. After an hour of this he has reassured
himself, and forgotten his friend. His eyes
shine. He looks almost handsome. His wife
is quite thrilled. She says he is wonderful, and
no one ever had such a husband.</p>

<p>But she says it sounds awfully dangerous.</p>

<p>"Well," he owns, "there's <i>some</i> risk, but we
ought to look at it impersonally."</p>

<p>She says: "Looking at it quite impersonally,
I think you had better not do it."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" he shouts; "don't you realize what
a tremendous help fire would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>yes</i>, dear," she says: "the plan's <i>perfect</i>.
But <i>you</i> shouldn't go. You have such important
work to attend to, here at home, without that.
Some younger, less valuable person&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear," Prometheus laughs, "you're
like every one else. You want to see the world
helped, and wars won, whatever the cost; but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
don't want either me or you to pay any part of the
price. You think all dangerous work should be
done by some other woman's husband."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prometheus purses her lips and her face
becomes obstinate. "I don't think <i>any</i> married
man has a right to take such risks," she observes.</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to hear what the single men
say about that," he retorts. "It's pretty thick to
expect <i>them</i> to die, they say, for other men's
wives."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prometheus shrugs at the shallowness of
those silly bachelors, and doesn't bother even to
comment on their point of view. Instead, she
says tactfully that she sees Prometheus has set his
heart upon going, and she wants him to feel perfectly
free to do just what he likes. Only there
are certain practical matters that one must consider.
There's the mortgage, and the laundress&mdash;unless
he'd like to have her do the washing
herself, which she'd be glad to do only he never
took those stones out of her way, in the brook&mdash;and
there's the bill for that last set of bear-skins
that she got for the windows; and she doesn't see
exactly how she can keep the home up by herself,
if he is to wander around neglecting his real-estate
business.</p>

<p>He says he won't be chained by his business.</p>

<p>She reminds him that she has already explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he's perfectly free.    But she just wants to know
how he wishes her to arrange in his absence.</p>

<span class="caption">Prometheus and Mrs. P.</span>
</div>

<p>"Very well, then," he blazes out, "I will give
up my plan: let it go! let men go to the devil!
I'm a prisoner, that's what it comes to. Like all
married men.    There isn't a damn one of us that's
allowed to do what the world needs, or anything
fine and unselfish."</p>

<p>She says that's unjust. She'd <i>love</i> to have him
be a great hero, and she always has said so, but she
doesn't see why he can't be one without leaving
his wife.</p>

</div>

<p>Prometheus, with a groan at his bondage, walks
out of the house, leaving her feeling injured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wondering at the hardness of men. And he
stamps up and down the yard, working himself up
into a state, and filling his mind with dark pictures.
Must every married man sit at home with his wife
in his arms, yearning for roving and achievement,
but yearning in vain? Pegged down, with a baby
as a peg, and a mortgage as jailer. Must every
young fellow choose between a fiancée and adventure?
Even when he does choose adventure, they
won't let him alone. There will always be some
girl at a window as he passes by, who will tempt
him to stop and play dolls with her, and stay indoors
for keeps, and wrestle with a mortgage for
exercise, and give up the road. Prometheus
swears. He tries to imagine what our epics would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
be like if wives wrote them: what heroes they'd
sing. Tidy, amiable, hearthstone heroes, who'd
always wind up the clock regularly, and never invent
dangerous airplanes or seek the North Pole.
Ulysses knitting sweaters by the fireside. George
Washington feeding canaries....</p>

<img src="images/ill_188.png" width="500" height="290" alt="Mrs. P. at an open window" title="Mrs. P at an open window" />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Prometheus sticks her head out of the
window: "I'll say just one word. I had supposed
we were partners, who had gone into the homemaking
business."</p>

<p>He says what good are homes if they emasculate
spirited men.</p>

<p>She says what good are spirited men if they
make the world homeless.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't intend to make the world homeless."</p>

<p>"No, only your wife."</p>

<p>Well, Prometheus gives in, of course, and abandons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his plan, as millions of others have done,
after talks with their wives. But ah, there is another
great force besides wives in the world.</p>

<p>It happened, as you know, that Prometheus
didn't get on well with Zeus. They had different
ideas as to how the world should be arranged.
Prometheus had more experience, but Zeus had the
power. Rivalry, combined with dislike,&mdash;that is
the great force I speak of. Zeus didn't wish men
to have fire. That was enough for Prometheus.
He told himself how incompetent Zeus was to
manage the world, how selfish he was, how indifferent
to men's need of fire. And that was
what braced him, at last, to escape from his wife,
and bring down an ember from heaven, and
bestow it upon men.</p>

<p>"General Rejoicing on Earth," said the newspapers,
when the deed had been done. To get
anything from heaven seemed as remarkable then
as it would now. Prometheus having accomplished
something was immediately ranked as
a hero. The Chamber of Commerce still privately
thought he had been rather wild, but after
a debate on the subject they gave him a dinner.
He was also presented with a loving cup and the
keys of the city. (He had no use for either, but
those primitive men thought them honors.) And
after the public reception Prometheus went home,
and had another reception behind closed doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from Mrs. Prometheus, who had had to sell preserves
and take in sewing while he was away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile everybody was using this new-fangled
thing, fire, except old folks who were set
in their ways and who said it was dangerous. And
presently men found it <i>was</i> dangerous. It wasn't
just a question of scorched fingers&mdash;it burned out
two caves. It roasted the toes of a lady who went
to sleep while cooking sliced elephant. And although
Prometheus had warned them and warned
them about being careless, and had shown them
exactly how to use it, he was blamed for each burn.</p>

<p>Some citizens were sarcastic and wrote him
elaborate letters, thanking him so much for the
suffering he had caused them and wishing him lots
of the same. Some were reasonable and patient,
but said he ought to have perfected this thing,
before exposing the lives of the community to a
bungling device. Others were seriously angry.
They wished him imprisoned. Why should a
man who had caused so much damage walk
about, free? They inquired where justice was,
at that rate; and held a mass-meeting.</p>

<p>It was owing to this that the gods discovered
what he had done. A volley of terrible thunder-claps
at once shook the skies, and Zeus had Prometheus
arrested. He was led off to Scythia&mdash;the
Siberia of those times&mdash;without trial, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
police left him chained to a rock there, and hurried
back home. And everybody sympathized
greatly with Mrs. Prometheus, for having a husband
who had wilfully disgraced his poor wife.
And they tried to be nice to her, but of course she
was under a cloud, and had to take in more sewing
than ever, and was never asked out. And a
year or two later some books were written, psychoanalyzing
Prometheus; and a professor who had
made a study of the economic interpretation of
heroes wrote an interesting paper discussing his
probable motives, pointing out that he must have
had relatives who wished to sell fire-insurance.</p>

<p>So his great deed ended in confusion. Like
other great deeds. All he got was a tumult of
mixed praise and blame from the crowd; and in
his dark moments he must have felt completely
discouraged, and wished that he'd just lived along
in comfort and minded his business.</p>

<p>His friend, who had warned him originally,
thought of him at times. He used to sit at home
and feel glad that for his part he'd kept out of
it. Then he would stir up the fire in his grate
and comfortably get into bed, and forget about
Prometheus, facing the winds and the vulture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>The Death of Logan</h2>


<p>Cockroaches, like the Wise Men, originally
lived in the East. They were at first far from
hardy&mdash;wretched travelers, hating changes of climate.
But when England began trading with the
Orient, the cockroach grew venturesome, and began
putting to sea as a stowaway. It was thus he
reached England.</p>

<p>He settled down at first in her seaports. Remained
there for years. People inland heard
of him, or saw him if they went to the coast, but
supposed themselves immune from his visits.
Now he owns the whole island. And wherever
the Englishman has journeyed, or settled, or trafficked,
except perhaps on the ice-floes of Labrador,
we now find the cockroach.</p>

<p>We all know his habits. He prefers to live in
kitchens and bakeries. Eats all kinds of food.
Eats shoes and the bindings of books. Also eats
his own relatives. Any relative that isn't good
and lively is at once eaten up.</p>

<p>You can tell the sexes apart (if you want to)
by this: The males don't drag their stomachs
on the ground the way the females do, and they
have better wings. Their wings are not good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
enough to use much, but still, they have little ones.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing about roaches is that
they live several years. Scientists say maybe five.
Owing to this they get to know all of a family's
ways, and can't be caught napping; they have
plenty of time to study roach powders and learn
to digest them. They dislike castor oil, though,
and keep away from where it has been rubbed.</p>

<p>Cockroaches are intelligent beings. Their natures
are human. They are not like other insects,
any more than dogs are like other animals. I
wish some man of science and sympathy would
interpret their lives.</p>

<p>That book that I dream of on roaches: will it
ever be written? Brown Beauty, or Only a Cockroach,
by Mary Gook Twillee&mdash;a book that little
children would read with wet eyes Sunday evenings.
No, that sounds like a pamphlet from the
Society for the Prevention of Stepping on Cockroaches.
We want nothing humanitarian. Still
less, a Work on the subject. We want a poet to
do for the cockroach what Maeterlinck has done
for the Bee.</p>

<p>If nobody else will, I shall probably have to do
it myself.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Since boyhood (I shall begin) I have felt the injustice
of men to the roach. Or not men, no;
but women. Men are in this matter more tolerant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
more live-and-let-live in their ways. But
women have condemned the roach not only unheard,
but unjudged. Not one of them has ever
tried petting a roach to gain his affection. Not
one of them has studied him or encouraged him
to show his good side. Some cockroaches, for
instance, are exceedingly playful and gay, but
what chance have they to show this, when being
stepped on, or chased with a broom? Suppose
we had treated dogs this way; scared them; made
fugitives of them!</p>

<p>No, the human race, though kind to its favorites,
is cruel to others. The pale little, lovable
cockroach has been given no show. If a housewife
would call to her roaches as she does to her
hens, "Here chick-chick, here cock-cock, here
roaches," how they would come scampering!
They would eat from her hand and lay eggs for
her&mdash;they do now, in fact.</p>

<p>"But the eggs are not legible&mdash;I mean edible,"
an excited reader objects. How do you know, my
poor prejudiced reader? Have you ever tried
them? And suppose they are not. Is that the
fault of the cockroach or God?</p>

<p>We should learn that blind enmity is not the attitude
to take toward strangers. The cockroach
has journeyed from Asia to come to our shores;
and because he looked queer, like most Asiatics,
he has been condemned from the start. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
charges are that he is dirty and that he eats the
food we leave lying around. Well, well, well!
Eats our food, does he? Is that a crime? Do
not birds do the same? And as to his being dirty,
have you ever kept dogs in your home? One dog
will bring in more dust and mud and loose hairs in
a day, than a colony, an empire, of cockroaches
will in a year.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to drive cockroaches away if
you wish. Not with powder or poison: this only
arouses their obstinacy. The right way is to import
other insects that prey upon roaches. The
hawk-ticks exterminate them as readily as wimples
do moles. The only thing to remember is that
then you have the hawk-ticks on hand, and they
float around the ceiling, and pounce down, and
hide in your ears.</p>

<p>You may be sure that <i>some</i> insects will live with
you. It's only a question which kind.</p>

<p>I remember Mr. Burbank once denied this when
we talked of the matter. Alluding to the fact
that the cockroach likes to eat other roaches, he
said why not breed a roach that wouldn't eat anything
else? When one introduced these into the
home they would first eat the old timers, and then
quietly devour each other until all were gone.</p>

<p>But how could a home remain bare of insects?
Nature abhors such a vacuum. Some men would
like to cover the whole world with porcelain tiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and make old Mother Earth, as we know her,
disappear from our view. They would sterilize
and scrub the whole planet, so as to make the
place sanitary. Well, I too feel that way at
times: we all have finicky moments. But in my
robust hours I sympathize with Nature. A hygienic
kitchen is unnatural. It should be swarming
with life. (The way mine is.)</p>

<p>I see a great deal of the roach when I visit my
kitchen. His habits, to be sure, are nocturnal.
But, then, so are mine. However, with a little
arranging, it is simple to prevent awkward clashes.
I do not like cockroaches on my table at supper,
for instance. Very well, I merely get me a table
with carved spiral legs. The roach cannot climb
up such legs. To hump himself over them
bruises him, and injures his stomach. And if
he tries to follow the spiral and goes round and
round, he soon becomes dizzy and falls with plaintive
cries to the floor. He can climb up my own
legs, since they are not spiral, you say? Yes, but
I rub castor oil on them before I enter the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cockroach has a fascinating personality.
He is not socialistic and faithful, like the ant, for
example: he is anarchistic, wild, temperamental,
and fond of adventure. He is also contemplative
by nature, like other philosophers. How
many an evening, at midnight, when I have wanted
a sandwich, I have found him and his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
standing still, lost in thought, by the sink. When
I poke him up, he blinks with his antennae and
slowly makes off. On the other hand, he can run
at high speed when the cook is pursuing him.
And he zigzags his course most ingeniously. He
uses his head. Captain Dodge, of the British
Navy, who first used this method to escape from
a submarine, is said to have learned how to zigzag
from the cockroaches aboard his own ship.
They should go down in history, those roaches,
with the geese that saved Rome.</p>

<p>Again and again I have tried to make a pet
of the cockroach, for I believe under his natural
distrust he has an affectionate nature. But
some hostile servant has invariably undone my
work. The only roach I succeeded in taming
was hardly a pet, because he used to hide with
the others half the time when he saw me, and
once in a fit of resentment he bit a hole in my
shoe. Still, he sometimes used to come at my
call when I brought him warm tea. Poor fellow!
poor Logan!&mdash;as I called him. He had
a difficult life. I think he was slightly dyspeptic.
Perhaps the tea was not good for him. He used
to run about uttering low, nervous moans before
moulting; and when his time came to mate, I
thought he never would find the right doe.
How well I remember my thrill when he picked
one at last, and when I knew that I was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
see their nuptial flight. Higher and higher they
circled over the clean blue linoleum, with their
short wings going so fast they fairly crackled,
till the air was electric: and then, swirling over
the dresser, their great moment came. Unhappily,
Logan, with his usual bad luck, bumped the
bread-box. The doe, with a shrill, morose whistle,
went and laid on the floor; but Logan
seemed too balked to pursue her. His flight
was a failure.</p>

<p>He rapidly grew old after this, and used to
keep by himself. He also got into the habit of
roaming around outdoors at night. Hated to
see other roaches mating by the bread-box, perhaps.
As he was too big to crawl back in under
the door when we shut it, he was sometimes
locked out when he roamed, and had to wait
until morning. This in the end caused his
death. One winter evening, blocked at the door,
he climbed the fire-escape and tried to get in the
bathroom window. But it chanced to be shut.
He hung there all night, barking hoarsely&mdash;and
I heard him, but never thought it was Logan.
When I went to look at the thermometer in the
morning, there he lay in the snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Portrait of a Lady</h2>


<p>Elsie has just got back from an expedition to
the Sea Islands. She had had her eye on those
islands for a long time, she tells me. They lie
off the coast of South Carolina, out of the way
of all traffic, and they looked to her like a good
hunting ground for African folk-lore. Her ethnological
field-work is always taking her off to
such places. I suppose that that Englishman,
Selous, used to go around studying maps, and
questioning natives about the best jungles for
lions, in much the same way that Elsie constantly
studies our continent, looking for some corner
of it that might interest an intelligent person.
The parts that are civilization to us, are mere
jungle to her: the houses and street cars are like
underbrush that she must push through, to get
to the places where her quarry is, and where she
really wakes up. In between, she lives in New
York with us,&mdash;she has to,&mdash;and conforms to
our ways, or to most of them anyhow, just as
Stefansson does with the Eskimos: she wears
the usual tribal adornments, and beadwork, and
skins; she's as dazzling as any other beauty,
in her box at the opera; and she sleeps and eats
in the family's big stone igloo near Fifth Avenue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
An unobservant citizen might almost suppose
she was one of us. But every now and then
her neglect of some small ceremonial sets our
whole tribe to chattering about her, and eyeing
her closely, and nodding their hairy coiffures or
their tall shiny hats, whispering around their
lodge-fires, evenings, that Elsie is queer.</p>

<p>When she went south this time, she first placed
herself "in the hands of the whites," as she detachedly
puts it: that is to say, she became the
guest of a white family on one of the more civilized
islands. This was a mistake. They were
interested in her plans, and they didn't in the least
mean to block them, but they felt it was necessary
for them to go around with her everywhere.
They wanted to be sure nothing happened,&mdash;and
Elsie wanted to be sure something did. "They
guarded me," she exclaimed, over and over, when
she told me this part of it. I got an impression of
her tramping off into the wilds, after breakfast,
to look around for what she was after, in her business-like
way; and of worried hostesses panting
along, following her,&mdash;in spite of the cold looks
they got.</p>

<p>There were also a number of small difficulties.
Her smoking, for instance. Her hostesses
didn't mind&mdash;much; but they had a brother, a
clergyman, just back from France, where he had
been in the Y. M. C. A. service; and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
upset <i>him</i>, they said. So instead of smoking
downstairs, by the fire, she had to do it up in her
room; and also burn Chinese incense after each
smoke, by request.</p>

<p>This clergyman held family prayer-meetings,
regularly, which everybody was supposed to attend;
but Elsie did not object. She is always
interested in ritual. And the singing was often
of negro spirituals, which she is collecting. She
has a recording phonograph nowadays, that
she takes around with her, to get them.</p>

<p>This wasn't what she had come down for,
however. It wasn't enough. And not being able
to explore without being "guarded" made the
country no use to her. The game was too shy to
be stalked with a whole crowd of whites. So in
order to make a new entrance, she decided on a
preliminary retreat. She left the islands, went
back to the mainland, and took a room in a boarding-house.</p>

<p>There was a lady in the neighborhood who once
had collected a few negro tales, but who told
Elsie that the colored folk around there didn't
tell them now. The lady wanted to be obliging,
and called in her cook to make sure; but the cook
corroborated her statement: didn't know any, no
ma'am.</p>

<p>Elsie formed the opinion that the cook probably
knew plenty of stories, but would not talk freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to whites. Few or none of them will. She kept
on making inquiries, however, as to possible
sources, and finally heard about one old negro
who was said to be chock-full of folk-lore. Elsie
got on his trail. She found him one day in the
street, and she soon won him over. He not only
told her all he knew, but he stopped a one-armed
man going by,&mdash;a dirty man with a wheel-barrow
full of old bottles&mdash;who, the old man said,
knew other stories, and who promptly made
good, telling several that Elsie took down, while
she sat on the curb.</p>

<p>This negro's name was Mr. Jack&mdash;at least that
is how Elsie speaks of him. He had lost his other
arm after a man had shot him up, he said, skylarking.
But he could do remarkable things with
his remaining one: open an umbrella, for instance.
He said that on one of the islands there were people
who knew lots of old tales. So Elsie engaged
Mr. Jack to go there with her, as guide, and off
they sailed, like the owl and the pussy-cat, only
with quite other intentions, and they ultimately
landed on the beach of the island he'd chosen.
There was no wharf. The Sea Islands are primitive.
They had to land in the surf. There
were two or three natives on the beach, just the
way there were when Columbus appeared, but
they didn't fall down and worship Elsie&mdash;as I
should have done. They just stared, and shuffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
away, and were lost in the bush. So Elsie
and Mr. Jack pushed on inland, and found a
negro with a horse, and Elsie gave him some
sticks of tobacco and bright-colored cloth, or
whatever currency it is she uses, and added him to
her expedition. His name was James Bone, and
he had a cart as well as a horse. They all got in
this cart and went cruising away into the interior.</p>

<p>It was raining like mad, I forgot to say, but
they didn't much mind, and besides it had a result
in the end that was lucky for Elsie. There was a
store on this island, and James Bone was heading
for it, with the idea of depositing Elsie there so
she could get shelter. But when they got there,
the white man who kept it said his wife was away,
and probably wouldn't be back that night because
of the rain. Elsie wished to stay anyhow, but he
flatly declined to take her in unless his wife came.</p>

<p>After making a silent study of his moral ideas,
which he expressed loudly, and writing them down
in her notebooks (I hope) for the Folkways Society,
Elsie quietly went out in the rain again to
continue her travels. It was now dark, however,
and Mr. Jack and James Bone were tired. The
expedition conferred. James Bone said they
could go to some friends of his, named (I think)
Peevie, who had a large house with five rooms in
it. So they steered for this landmark. But when
they arrived, very late, all the five rooms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
found to be full. In addition to the whole
Peevie family, which was sufficiently numerous,
there were several Peevie relations and guests
who had come on for a funeral. But James Bone
was insistent. He went indoors and stirred them
up and made a lot of talk and excitement, and
never stopped until the funeral guests rose and
went away, in the rain; and with them all the
relations except old Aunt Justine and her nieces.
These and the regular family somehow packed
themselves into three rooms, and gave up the two
best to Elsie, who promptly retired. I don't
know where Mr. Jack slept. Maybe under the
cart.</p>

<p>This cabin was about the most comfortable
place Elsie stayed. She could smoke all she
wished, she had a fireplace, and the cooking was
good. Her two rooms were only six by ten
apiece, but all the more cozy. Old Aunt Justine
who at first had not liked it, thawed after a while,
and sat around with Elsie and smoked with her
and told her old tales. She was a picturesque
ancient, Elsie says, and wore a large clean white
turban.</p>

<p>Everybody came and told Elsie all the stories
they knew. If any one passed on the road, he
was hailed to come in: "Hi, Numph, d'you
wanter make a quarter, telling this lady a
story?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"We wouldn't have told you any, though, if you
had stayed at the store," James Bone said. "We
don't have no traffic with the white folks, only
buying or selling. They keep to themselves, and
we keep to ourselves, 'cept for that."</p>

<p>Elsie put it all down. "No nexus exists but the
economic one between the two groups," she wrote.
Then, having exhausted this island, she packed up
her notebooks, and she and Mr. Jack put to sea
again to visit one other.</p>

<p>This other was an island where Mr. Jack said
he had relatives, whom he would love dearly to
see again if they were alive. He had lived right
over on the mainland without visiting them for
about twenty years, until Elsie came along and
roused his energies; but he now felt warmed up.
When they landed, however, none of his relatives
were at all glad to see him. He and Elsie wandered
around for a while, getting a chilling reception,
until late in the day they met some women
who were opening oysters. One of these exclaimed
at seeing Mr. Jack, and gave him a great
welcome. An old sweetheart, Elsie conjectured.
Mr. Jack introduced her. These women gave
Elsie a handful of oysters to eat for her supper,
and she got out some of her own thick bran cookies
which are so good for the stomach, and they
sat by the fire and talked together until it was midnight.
Then the oyster boat left for the mainland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with Elsie aboard. And luckily there was a
man on that boat who knew some valuable stories,
so Elsie sat up all night taking them down, by a
ship's lamp, as they sailed. The wind was light
and it was five hours before they reached port.</p>

<p>She parted with Mr. Jack, on the oyster-dock
landing, at dawn. "I stayed wid you to de en',"
he said; and afterwards mailed her her rubbers.</p>

<p>There is more to this story, about her visiting
the Cherokee Indians down there. But I don't remember
the Cherokee chapter as well as the old
Mr. Jack one. Still I hope this gives some kind
of picture of Elsie's real life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h2>Grandfather's Three Lives</h2>


<p>A great Englishman died a few years ago, little
known in America. His name, Sir Charles Dilke.
A statesman, a radical, a republican; and a strong
solid man.</p>

<p>There is one thing that strikes you about some
of these leaders, in England: the number of advantages
they have when they're boys, growing up.
It gives them a tremendous head-start. Charles
Dilke began meeting great men when he was a
mere child: the Duke of Wellington, Thackeray,
Dickens,&mdash;I could name a long list. And he had
the close companionship of a grandfather, a man
of distinction, who treated him as an equal, and
devoted himself to his grandson's development.</p>

<p>A fortunate boy.</p>

<p>Think of other small boys, who show signs of
fine brains and strong characters. Are they ever
introduced to Thackeray or treated as equals?
No, they're taught to respect their dull fathers
and their fathers' ideas. They are taught not to
have any separate ideas of their own. Or at
best they run wild with no wise elder friend, like
Charles Dilke's.</p>

<p>Here is one of his grandfather's letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Shows the tone of their friendship. The boy has
just won an English Essay Prize, and "they say
that parts of my essay were vulgar," he writes.
"My special interest," his grandfather answers,
"is aroused by the charge of occasional vulgarity.
If it be true, it is not improbable that the
writer caught the infection from his grandfather.
With one half the world, in its judgment of
literature and life, vulgarity is the opposite of
gentility, and gentility is merely negative, and
implies the absence of all character, and, in language,
of all idiom, all bone and muscle....
You may find in Shakespeare household words and
phrases from every condition and walk in life&mdash;as
much coarseness as you please to look for&mdash;anything
and everything except gentility and vulgarity.
Occasional vulgarity is, therefore, a question
on which I refuse to take the opinion of any
man not well known to me."</p>

<p>Good for Grandfather! Eh? He was a
pretty interesting old boy. He might have been
a great man himself, if he could have brought
himself up. But Great-grandfather had been in
the government's service in England, some position
in the Navy Department, or the Admiralty,
as they call it. And when his son grew up, he
got him a place in the Admiralty too. He meant
well, but Grandfather might have done better
without.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It gave him a berth, and a chance to lie back
and look on. And while that helped to ripen his
wisdom, it sapped his initiative.</p>

<p>He had a fine mind; clear, impartial. Strong
radical views. He had character, integrity, insight.
A man of much weight. But he saw there
was much to be learned and observed about life,
and his instinct was to go slow, and quietly study
its problems. "Instead," you say, "of immediately
solving them like other young men!" But
instead, too,&mdash;for such was his instinct&mdash;of <i>handling</i>
the problems. He wished to know more and
feel wiser before he dealt with them. He had the
preparatory attitude.</p>

<p>The trouble with the preparatory attitude is
there's no end to it. There is so much to learn in
this world that it won't do to wait. If you wait
to fit yourself before acting, you never will act.
You will somehow lose the habit of acting. Study
too conscientiously the one hundred best books on
swimming, and of course you'll learn a great deal
about it, but you never will swim.</p>

<p>This was Grandfather's type. If he had
been kicked out alone into the world and found
every one fighting him, and if he had had to fight
back, and fight hard, from his boyhood, it would
have taught him the one thing he needed&mdash;more
force for his powers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was, he remained in the Admiralty.
Studying life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_210.png" width="500" height="240" alt="The Preparatory Attitude" title="The Preparatory Attitude" />
<span class="caption">The Preparatory Attitude</span>
</div>

<p>Grandfather was thirty-seven years old when
Great-grandfather died. He (Grandfather) had
been writing for the magazines for quite a long
time,&mdash;he was only twenty-six when the Quarterly
Review editors began to speak highly of him.</p>

<p>He now bought the London Athenaeum, which,
though just born, was dying. Under Grandfather's
editorship it became an important authority.
It was known all over the world soon.
But Grandfather wasn't. He never signed one
of his articles, not even pseudonymously. And
during the sixteen years in which he had control
of the paper, this remarkable man withdrew altogether
from general society, in order, he said, to
avoid making literary acquaintances which might
either prove annoying to him, or be supposed to
compromise the integrity of his journal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>That rings hollow, that reason. He doubtless
thought it true; but it wasn't. He withdrew
from society, probably, because he liked withdrawing.
With the gifts of a great man he didn't
have a great man's robustness. Some kink in him
held him back, and kept him from jousting and
tournaments. He should have been psychoanalyzed.
It may have been such a small kink.</p>

<p>I doubt if he ever would have married, but it
happened quite young. He was under nineteen,
and the pretty girl he married still younger.
Maybe she married <i>him</i>. They had one son,
soon after their marriage; but no other children.</p>

<p>I wonder if Grandfather was a case of suppressed
personality. It wasn't a weak personality.
It would not stay suppressed. But it didn't come
out boldly and naturally, and live a full life. Not
as full a life as its own wisdom and strength made
appropriate. He achieved several things, and
they weren't unimportant or small, yet he constantly
slighted his life-work; in fact, hardly spoke
of it. Modern psychologists do not call this
attitude modesty, like our nice naïve fathers. No,
they say it comes oftenest from the sexual errors
of boyhood. For instance, repression. Or
shame at misguided indulgence.</p>

<p>This kind of boyhood is unfortunate, but it
might do small harm, if it weren't for the sad
sense of guilt with which it stains a man's mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Men try to forget it, and do: but their subconsciousness
never forgets. To be cured, a man
must face and remember his past, open-eyed, and
see his mistakes philosophically and understand
better: understand what we all are, and what
human nature is made of, and how it is distorted
in youth by a rigid environment. The average
moralist or parent won't tell us these things.
But until we have learned them, a good many of
us feel wicked, and can't put behind us the
wretched mistakes of our youth. We don't know
enough to regard our young struggles with sympathy.
Our ignorance makes us believe we have
blackened our souls. And the man who keeps
silent and never tells, and hence never learns,
goes through the world semi-subdued. Never
gets what it owes him.</p>

<p>Was Grandfather Dilke such a case? I've no
warrant for saying so. His conscience may have
troubled him, possibly, for some quite different
reason. He may have secretly hated some relative
whom he should have loved. He may have
done some small wrong and unfortunately not
been found out. But whatever the reason was,
he lived an odd, back-groundish life&mdash;for a man
of his caliber. And his life didn't satisfy him.
And this was his fault, not the world's.</p>

<p>The birth of a son, however, in a way gives a
man a fresh chance. He decides to live a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and far better life through his son. Whenever a
parent feels blue, or is not making good, he
immediately declares that his hopes are in his
little son anyhow. Then he has a sad, comfortable
glow at his own self-effacement. Oh, these
shirking fathers! They allow <i>themselves</i> to give
way to weariness, or be halted by fears; but expect
a son, when <i>he</i> comes to such moments, to
find them quite jolly. He's to make up for the
weakness of his father, and carry his own burdens,
too!</p>

<p>I regret to say Grandfather Dilke sought relief
in this way. Although young, strong, and
gifted, he said when his own son was born that he
then and there committed all his dreams of
achievement to Baby. Baby was to go out in the
world and do his papa honor.</p>

<p>The child was called Wentworth, and it grew
up sound, healthy, and kind. But when poor Mr.
Dilke bet on Wentworth, he backed the wrong
horse. Wentworth didn't have anything in him
of the statesman or scholar. He was idle at
studies. No head for them. What he liked
was athletics. He liked comradeship and enjoying
life generally&mdash;in a nice way, however. A
simple, conservative-minded and limited soul.
During his early years in London he was principally
known to his friends for never missing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
night at the opera. And he was devoted to
shooting-parties.</p>

<p>Later on, he became still more trying, it would
seem, to his parent. Instead of remaining in his
place as a plain disappointment, he began to be
prominent; and, stupidly, in just the wrong field.
He became a sort of parody of the man his father
had hoped he would be. He hadn't the brains,
for example, to do anything in the learned Athenaeum,
but he founded The Gardeners' Chronicle
and the Agricultural Gazette. He did well with
them, too, which was irritating. He turned out
to be a good man of business.</p>

<p>About this time a National Exhibition of some
sort was held, and Wentworth was in on it.
(It was an exhibition of "art manufacturers.")
Then somebody got the idea of repeating it on a
large scale and including foreign nations: in fact
to make it the first of World's Fairs. So Wentworth
and the others met the Prince Consort,
to get Royalty's blessing.</p>

<p>The Prince Consort liked the plan immensely.
He made it his hobby. Numerous committees
were appointed, in true simian style, and amid
endless speeches and palaverings, the thing was
arranged. Wentworth, except when on shooting-parties,
worked hard for it.</p>

<p>This made a great noise; but I doubt if it impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Mr. Dilke. It was at bottom cheap stuff
which any advertiser or promoter could do. It
sounded well; it made a man prominent, but it
didn't take brains. What Mr. Dilke had hoped
or intended for his son I don't know; perhaps
nothing definite; but he certainly wanted something
that counted. He wanted him to make a
contribution to the needs of mankind. Some
achievement in scholarship, or some hand in the
steering of England.</p>

<p>Mr. Dilke was, potentially, anyhow, a big sort
of man, like a nation's prime minister: a publicist,
not a mere showman. And for years he had given
all his thoughts to his son's career. His son had
been the one he first thought of when he woke in
the morning, and the last one that stayed in his
mind when he got into bed. And he hadn't just
mooned around about him, he had worked for his
welfare, planned each step of his education, for
instance, and pondered his plans.</p>

<p>And then the creature grows up to run The
Gardeners' Chronicle, and work for World Fairs.</p>

<p>There were some small advantages. The creature
was brought into relations with prominent
men and kings throughout Europe, mostly figureheads,
perhaps, but not all; and these relations
were destined to be of use to the Dilkes later on.
But it must have seemed awfully silly to Grandfather
to see Wentworth being presented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
medals, and honors, and gifts from foreign governments.
And as though this weren't enough,
Queen Victoria wished to make him a baronet!
Mr. Dilke, being a radical, was opposed to his
taking a title; so Wentworth, who was fifty-one,
declined it, like a dutiful child. But the Queen
made a personal matter of it, so he had to accept.
It seems that he and the Prince Consort had become
quite good friends&mdash;both being pleasant,
gentlemanly, and wooden (at least in some ways),
and having in common an innocent love of World
Fairs; and this had endeared Wentworth Dilke,
more or less, to the Queen. So, after the Prince
Consort died, and while she was feeling her grief,
she pressed this small title on Wentworth because
the Prince liked him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ill_216.png" width="220" height="264" alt="He had medals from potentates." title="He had medals from potentates." />
<span class="caption">He had medals from potentates.</span>
</div>

<p>Wentworth was now a powerfully connected
person and a vastly more
important man in the public
eye than Grandfather
was. But he and his father
lived in the same
house; and, although Mr.
Dilke didn't say much, he
had his own scale of values;
and, measured by any
such scale, Wentworth
was a great disappointment.
Their daily relations were kindly, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
this; but Wentworth knew well, all the time,
he was deemed an inferior. When he was out and
about, in the public eye, he may have felt like a
lord, but when he came home nights he had to
check his pride at the door.</p>

<p>Meantime he had married and had two sons;
and Charles, the elder, was bright. So Mr.
Dilke, the incorrigible, began life all over again.
He hadn't been satisfied with his own life, and far
less with Wentworth's, but he planned a third
career for himself in this promising grandson.
He didn't merely take an interest in the child,
or just make him his hobby. He centered his
whole mind upon him. He made it his business
in life to develop that infant&mdash;in order that
through him he might at last reach the front row.</p>

<p>And this time he won. It looked doubtful at
first; Charles was nervous and frail, and hence
backward. His mind was too excitable and his
health too poor to send him to school. That's
a handicap in England; school associations and
training count much. However, the boy easily
mastered his studies at home, and he often met
eminent men who came around to the house, and
he made some experiments in literature&mdash;in fact,
wrote a novel. And when sixteen, he met a beautiful
girl, Emilia Strong, whom he worshiped.
And he traveled, and talked with his grandfather;
and so he grew up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>At eighteen his health grew much better: in fact,
grew robust. He immediately entered Cambridge,
and there he began a new life. This was
a splendid thing for him, in a number of ways.
For instance, one of the first things he did was to
go in for athletics. He had a flat, narrow chest,
sloping shoulders; but the rowing men trained
him; and he worked until he became a good oar,
and could row on a crew.</p>

<p>He had lived almost entirely with grown-ups
before going to college, and was much more mature
and well-informed than the fellows he met
there. But some parts of his nature had never
had a chance to come out; his sense of fun, for example.
He now began having good times with
boys of his own age. He worked so hard at his
rowing that he finally stroked the first crew. And
"nobody could make more noise at a boating supper,"
one of his friends said. He even got into a
scrape and was deprived of a scholarship he had
won.</p>

<p>All these new ways of Charles&mdash;except the
scrape, possibly&mdash;must have seemed right and normal,
and even, perhaps, reassuring to his father,
Sir Wentworth. But Sir Wentworth became
alarmed lest they shouldn't please Mr. Dilke.
He feared Mr. Dilke was going to be disappointed
all over again, by a student who found
university life too full of pleasure. The unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
baronet, therefore, wrote Charles for
heaven's sake to be studious.</p>

<p>He need not have worried. Charles became a
wonder at studies. And it wasn't just brilliance&mdash;it
was long, steady hours, plus brains and concentration,
that did it. One thing that helped
him do so much was that he never wasted time&mdash;he
used every spare minute for something. He
"would even get in ten minutes of work between
river and Hall." He not only became a prize
scholar and oarsman, but won walking races; he
joined the Volunteers and became a crack rifle
shot, and went in for debating.</p>

<p>His votes and speeches in the debates show the
trend of his mind, which was balanced yet radical,
like his grandfather's, and always progressive.
The American Civil War, which was then being
fought, was debated; and the undergraduates
voted for the Confederate side, three to one.
This was the general feeling in England. But
Charles was for the North. Again, when Lord
Palmerston was helping to start the Greek
monarchy, Charles spoke in favor of a Greek
republic, in a college debate.</p>

<p>He wrote long letters to his grandfather regularly
about studies and politics, and sent him able
analyses and criticisms of articles in the Athenaeum.
The old man at first had been rather silent
because of the athletics; but as Charles' mind developed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and as he continued winning prizes in
studies, Mr. Dilke grew happier and happier.
They were forever corresponding, and were on the
most affectionate terms.</p>

<p>Then, one day, a telegram came for Charles,
and he hurried home. Wentworth was on the
lawn, crying. "He lives only to see you," he said.</p>

<p>"I went upstairs," Charles wrote afterward,
"and sat down by the sofa on which lay the Grand,
looking haggard, but still a noble wreck. I took
his hand, and he began to talk of trivial matters....
He seemed to be testing his strength, for
at last he said: 'I shall be able to talk to-morrow;
I may last some weeks; but were it not for the
pang that all of you would feel, I should prefer
that it should end at once. I have had a good
time of it.'"</p>

<p>The next day they had their last talk. Mr.
Dilke made his boy a present he had planned for
his birthday, and entrusted him with the disposition
of his papers and manuscripts. And he told
him, "I have nothing more to say but that you
have fulfilled&mdash;my every hope&mdash;beyond all measure&mdash;and&mdash;I
am deeply&mdash;grateful."</p>

<p>So he died.</p>

<p>Charles went back to Cambridge and finished
his course with the greatest distinction. He
then began contributing to the Athenaeum, and
planning to write books. "A History of Radicalism,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for example. "The Effects Upon Radicalism
of Increased Facility of Communication."
"Development of the Principle of Love of Country
Into That of Love of Man." In politics he
took the Irish Catholic side of the Irish Question;
he wrote strongly in favor of removing the political
disabilities of women, and he criticized the
severity of white men toward natives in the
tropics.</p>

<p>He also had a row with his father. Sir Wentworth
was vexed because Charles didn't wish to
come to his shooting-parties.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-two, Charles made a tour
of the world, and recorded his observations in a
remarkable book. It was a solid, serious volume,
yet written in a vein of high spirits. It dealt with
Canada, the United States&mdash;East, South, and
West&mdash;New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon and India;
it was a study of what Anglo-Saxons were doing
in these great civilizations. Charles mailed
his MSS. to England, and Sir Wentworth took it
upon himself to correct the proofs, in order to
hurry the book through the press. The result
was a crop of blunders. But still, it was an enormous
success. It ran through three editions
rapidly, and brought Charles the friendship of
some great men.</p>

<p>Meantime in his twenty-fifth year he was elected
to Parliament&mdash;at the very election at which Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Wentworth lost his seat, by the way. Charles
advocated laws ('way back in the Sixties) to prohibit
child labor, to recognize trades unions, and
stop the buying of commissions in the army. He
advised English workmen not to join the regular
political parties, but to start a Labor Party of
their own and gain influence that way. He also
upset his father a good deal by urging amendments
to the game laws. His first speech in Parliament
was on some dry, technical subject, but he showed
himself so well-informed, so full of detailed
knowledge and foreign comparisons, that he was
immediately put on a committee and began to
make his way in the House.</p>

<p>It's interesting to look back and see how able
men get their start.</p>

<p>In his twenty-eighth year this able man got into
frightful hot water. He said publicly that a
miserable moral and political tone resulted from the
nation's retaining a lot of sinecure offices&mdash;Hereditary
Grand Falconer, and all that sort of thing.
He pointed out that the Duke of Edinburgh had
been given a naval command without much naval
training, and he advocated promotion by merit
instead of by claims due to birth. He allowed
himself to criticize some large grants of money to
the monarchy. His remarks indicated that theoretically
he preferred a republic. For this he was
denounced by the papers, and socially shunned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
He was accused of disloyalty and treason, with the
greatest heat, everywhere. His name was a byword.
The Prince of Wales happened about this
time to get very ill, and this added still further to
the anger men felt at Charles Dilke.</p>

<p>He didn't back down. He went out and made
speeches to workmen, repeating his anti-King
criticisms. There was rioting by Tory roughs&mdash;iron
bars thrown&mdash;men injured and killed.
Crowds collected who swore that Dilke should
not get away alive from the hall. He waited
till the excitement was hottest, then came out the
main door alone, stood quietly looking at them,
lit a cigar, and walked off.</p>

<p>He did, however, gradually calm down the
nation in one way, by showing them that, though
he objected to monarchical errors, he didn't wish
to upset the monarchy while it suited the people.
He thought it absurd, but it would be still more
absurd to upset it&mdash;that is to say, while those
governed wanted it. This attitude, and time
(several years of it) slowly stilled the excitement.
The net result was to make this man a notable and
recognized power.</p>

<p>His power kept growing. His influence was
great in the House. His views were strong, but
reasoned and sane, and his industry endless. He
was now forty-two. Gladstone, with whom he
tilted at first, picked him as his successor. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
looked as though this great progressive would be
premier of England.</p>

<p>Then, in a night, the Fates crushed him. Returning
home from a dinner in his honor, he
found a letter there, waiting.</p>

<p>It said that the wife of a member of Parliament
had confessed to her husband that she had been
unfaithful to him with Charles Dilke soon after
her marriage.</p>

<p>This, of course, meant a scandal. And a scandal
meant he couldn't be premier. He couldn't
even sit in the cabinet. His career was destroyed.</p>

<p>Sir Charles (as he now was) had been married,
but his wife had soon died. After ten years as a
widower, he had become engaged to Emilia Strong&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;the same Emilia whom he had
worshiped when he was sixteen. (She had been
married, too, in the meantime, but she now was a
widow.) His principal concern with this blow
was not to let it hurt her. He sent her the news,
told her he was innocent, and added, "I feel this
may kill you&mdash;and it will kill me, either if it kills
you or if you don't believe me."</p>

<p>She stood by him, married him. They had
nineteen years of each other. He was sixty-one
when she died in his arms. He lived to be sixty-eight.</p>

<p>He never could clear his name of the scandal,
though he took it to court. They failed to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
he was guilty, but he couldn't <i>prove</i> that he wasn't.
So he never was premier, and he never again sat
in the cabinet.</p>

<p>His friends said his whole career showed
that the scandal was false. They stood by him
strongly. But the People, whom he would have
served with such courage, did not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Story of a Farmer</h2>


<p>There once was a tall husky fellow, big hands
and feet; not much education. (Though he came
of a fairly good family.) He had very bad teeth.
His father had left him a farm, and that was his
great interest&mdash;farming. He had the kind of
feeling about farming that a good shoemaker has
about shoes. Of course, he complained more or
less, and felt dissatisfied and discouraged, and
threatened to give up his farm when things went
badly. But there was nothing else he could have
willingly turned to; and he was never weary of
experimenting with different ways of planting his
crops.</p>

<p>He was a sound-thinking man, and men trusted
him. He grew prominent. Held some offices.
As a result, when he was forty-three he had to go
away from home for some years. This was while
he was managing an army. And I ought to
explain that it was a hard army to manage. It
was not only badly equipped and poorly trained,
but sometimes the men would run away in the
midst of a battle. That made this man angry.
He was ordinarily composed and benign in his
manner, but when he saw the soldiers showing fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he used to become violently aroused, and would
swear at them and strike them. His nature
loathed cowardice. He cared nothing for danger
himself, perhaps because of his teeth, and he
couldn't understand why these other men dreaded
to die.</p>

<p>All his life, when he was at table with others,
he used to sit there in silence, drumming on the
cloth with his fork. He seldom joked. He was
hardly ever playful. People said he was too
dignified, too solemn. Well! one isn't apt to be
a comedian, precisely, with toothache. He was
only twenty-two when he began having his teeth
pulled, they tortured him so; and he kept on
losing them, painfully, year after year.</p>

<p>About this army again. He didn't want to
manage it. He had had quite a liking for military
work, as a youth, and had even gone on a
small expedition to see active service, though
his mother had interfered all she could, and tried
hard to prevent him. But as this was all the
experience he ever had had, and as he had never
studied warfare, he didn't know anything about
handling large bodies of troops.</p>

<p>However, he had a clear mind and a good
natural insight; and in spite of his ignorance, of
which he was painfully conscious, he managed to
win the war, and then thankfully returned to his
farm. He went back with enthusiasm. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
been away for eight years altogether, and for six
of those years he did not once set foot on his
fields. He had found time, however, in between
whiles, to talk with the farmers in the northerly
parts of his country, and collect new ideas. He
now began to experiment with plaster of Paris
and powdered stone as fertilizers. He tried
clover, rye, peas, oats and carrots to strengthen
his land. He tried mud. He planted potatoes
with manure, and potatoes without, and noted exactly
what the difference was in the yield. His
diary speaks of the chinch bugs attacking his corn,
and of the mean way the rain had of passing by
on the other side of the river, falling generously
there, while "not enough fell here to wet a handkerchief."
He laboriously calculated the number
of seed in a pound (this retired Commander!)
and found that red clover had 71,000, timothy
298,000 and barley 8,925.</p>

<p>He also began at this time to use false teeth,
which fitted him badly. And he was laid up
occasionally with malaria, and fever and ague.
And he was called upon to help frame a constitution
for his little nation. A busy period. He
had an attack of rheumatism, too, which lasted
over six months, and it was sometimes so bad he
could hardly raise his hand to his head or turn
over in bed. And when the national constitution
had been adopted they elected him president.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
That meant a lot of outside work for another
eight years.</p>

<p>Some of this work he hated. He hated
speech-making for instance. At his inauguration
he was so agitated and embarrassed that men
saw he trembled, and when he read his speech his
voice was almost too low to be heard. He was
always very conscious of having a poor education,
and being a bad speller and so forth. But the
people didn't care about that, much: they trusted
his judgment, and admired the man's goodness
and spirit.</p>

<p>A sculptor was sent to make a statue of him,
late in his life. He couldn't get him to pose
satisfactorily. No noble attitudes. In vain did
the sculptor talk about state affairs and that war.
Such things did not stir him. He remained
either stiff or relaxed. But one day they were
out on the farm together; and as this man
watched his live-stock, he unconsciously took a
fine, alive attitude. So the sculptor made a
statue of him that way; and that statue is famous.</p>

<p>In spite of his usual benignity, this man had a
temper. He used to get very sore and warm at
times, when unfairly criticized. At one of his
cabinet meetings, for instance, says a contemporary,
he became "much inflamed, got into one of
those passions when he cannot command himself,
ran on much on the personal abuse which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
bestowed on him [and said] that by God he had
rather be in his grave than in his present situation.
That he had rather be on his farm than to be
made emperor of the world, and yet that they
were charging him with wanting to be a king.
That that rascal Freneau sent him three of his
papers every day, as if he thought he would become
the distributor of his papers; that he could
see nothing in this but an impudent design to insult
him," etc., etc. Poor, stung human being;
with all his serenity gone!</p>

<p>A great portrait painter said of him that his
features were indicative of the strongest and most
ungovernable passions; and had he been born in
the forests, it was his opinion that he would have
been the fiercest man among the savage tribes.</p>

<p>This was the temperament that smoldered in
him: the lurking flame that he had to live with
daily. But by reflection and resolution he obtained
a firm ascendancy over it.</p>

<p>One night when he was sixty-seven years old
he woke up at about two in the morning feeling
very unwell. He had had a sore throat, and
now he couldn't swallow; felt suffocated. A
miserable feeling. His wife would have got up
to call a servant; but he wouldn't allow her to do
it lest she should catch cold. He lay there for
four hours in the cold bedroom, his body in a chill,
before receiving any attention or before even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
fire was lighted. Then they sent for the doctors.
They bled the old hero three times, taking the
last time a quart. He was physically a vigorous
man, but this weakened him greatly. "I find I
am going," he said. He was in great pain, and
said, "Doctor, I die hard." A little later he
added: "I feel I am going. I thank you for
your attention, you had better not take any more
trouble about me, but let me go off quietly." His
breathing became much easier just at the end.</p>

<p>Did he look back over his life as he lay there,
waiting, and what did he think of it? That his
farming had been interesting though difficult, and
much interrupted? That his fellow-men had
really asked a good many sacrifices of him, and
not left him nearly as much time as he wished for
his fields? Or did he think that in death he
would at least have no more trouble with teeth?
A set of dental instruments was found in one of
his drawers after the funeral. In others were
memoranda about affairs of state he had worked
at, and various kinds of plows he had tried, and
his farming accounts.</p>

<p>His name was George Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
